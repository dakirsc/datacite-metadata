change poses a threat to biodiversity, and it is unclear whether\n species can adapt to or tolerate new conditions, or migrate to areas with\n suitable habitats. Reconstructions of range shifts that occurred in\n response to environmental changes since the last glacial maximum from\n species distribution models (SDMs) can provide useful data to inform\n conservation efforts. However, different SDM algorithms and climate\n reconstructions often produce contrasting patterns, and validation methods\n typically focus on accuracy in recreating current distributions, limiting\n their relevance for assessing predictions to the past or future. We\n modeled historically suitable habitat for the threatened North American\n tree green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) using 24 SDMs built using two\n climate models, three calibration regions, and four modeling algorithms.\n We evaluated the SDMs using contemporary data with spatial block\n cross-validation and compared the relative support for alternative models\n using a novel integrative method based on coupled demographic-genetic\n simulations. We simulated genomic datasets using habitat suitability of\n each of the 24 SDMs in a spatially-explicit model. Approximate Bayesian\n Computation (ABC) was then used to evaluate the support for alternative\n SDMs through comparisons to an empirical population genomic dataset.\n Models had very similar performance when assessed with contemporary\n occurrences using spatial cross-validation, but ABC model selection\n analyses consistently supported SDMs based on the CCSM climate model, an\n intermediate calibration extent, and the generalized linear modeling\n algorithm. Finally, we projected the future range of green ash under four\n climate change scenarios. Future projections using the SDMs selected via\n ABC suggest only minor shifts in suitable habitat for this species, while\n some of those that were rejected predicted dramatic changes. Our results\n highlight the different inferences that may result from the application of\n alternative distribution modeling algorithms and provide a novel approach\n for selecting among a set of competing SDMs with independent data."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["# Integrating genomic data and simulations to evaluate alternative species\n distribution models and improve predictions of glacial refugia and future\n responses to climate change\n [https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.s7h44j1fx](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.s7h44j1fx) This repository contains analysis scripts and input data files associated with the integrated distributional, demographic, and coalescent (iDDC; He et al. 2013) modeling analysis conducted to compare alternative species distribution models (SDMs) for green ash (*Fraxinus pennslvanica*) in Naugthin et al. (2024) *Ecography*. ## Description of the data and file structure Simulations for the project were conducted using the R script `hSC_Ash_with_enms.R`.  This script uses the R package holoSimCell (available from [https://github.com/stranda/holoSimCell](https://github.com/stranda/holoSimCell) to simulate post-glacial expansion of green ash in eastern North America.  We also include the singularity (now apptainer, [https://apptainer.org](https://apptainer.org)) container used for these simulations (`holosim.simg`) in the repository.  The most recent version of the `holosim` container can also be pulled from [https://hub.docker.com/r/astrand/holosim](https://hub.docker.com/r/astrand/holosim). Outputs of the simulations under 24 different SDMs are saved in the reference table: `ENMcomparison_RT_50k_subset.csv`, which is provided in zipped format in `ENMcomparison_RT_50k_subset.zip`.  This file contains simulation parameters, measures of biotic velocity (see Castilla et al. 2024, [https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.14754](https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.14754)) and a total of 473 summary statistics retained for each simulation replicate.  Each of the 24 SDMs were simulated 50,000 times for ABC analyses.  We also include a .csv file with observed values for these same summary statistics: `Ash_obs_subset_2Oct20.csv`.  The observed summary statistic file is shared with Castilla et al. 2024, but the reference table has been expanded considerably for this project.  Descriptions of columns in `ENMcomparison_RT_50k_subset.csv` and `Ash_obs_subset_2Oct20.csv` can be found below. Scripts to perform ABC model selection and cross validation analyses presented in our manuscript are included in `ABC.zip` (see Code/Software below for descriptions).  ABC analyses can be repeated using these scripts and the two .csv files described above. This repository also contains R scripts used to define the study region for our analysis (in `study_region.zip`), fit correlative species distribution (or ecological niche) models, and predict habitat suitability in 2080 under each of the models considered in this project (both in the `code/` subdirectory in `enms.zip`).  Hindcasted and forecasted SDMs are also provided in raster format in the `predictions/ `and `predictions_future/` subdirectories in `enms.zip` (see Code/Software below for more information).

The “last” or “lowest” layer represents available land (uncovered by sea and ice) 21 Kybp, and the “top” or “first layer” the present, with one layer per 30 years across this period. Values are 1 (available) and NA (unavailable). 3. `study_region/study_region_resampled_to_genetic_demographic_simulation_resolution.tif` - Raster in GeoTIFF format with all cells equal to 1 and in the equal-area spatial resolution used in the genetic/demographic simulations. This is a single layer raster.

We generated a simulated\n communication network to investigate how variation in individual\n communication behaviours generates network effects, and how this\n communication network’s structure feeds back to affect future signalling\n interactions. We simulated competitive acoustic signalling interactions\n among chorusing individuals and varied several parameters related to\n communication and chorus size to examine their effects on calling output\n and social connections. Larger choruses had higher noise levels, and this\n reduced network density and altered the relationships between individual\n traits and communication network position. Hearing sensitivity interacted\n with chorus size to affect both individuals’ positions in the network and\n the acoustic output of the chorus. Physical proximity to competitors\n influenced signalling, but a distinctive communication network structure\n emerged when signal active space was limited. Our model raises novel\n predictions about communication networks that could be tested\n experimentally, and identifies aspects of information processing in\n complex environments that remain to be investigated. "],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["# Data for: Collective signalling is shaped by feedbacks between signaller\n variation, receiver perception, and acoustic environment in a simulated\n communication network By Michael Reichert - 12/05/2023. Contact for\n questions ### **Data and code used for simulations and analyses.** There\n are 7 files (in addition to this readme file). Data files uploaded to\n Dryad. Code files available on Zenodo. #### 1. Simulation\\_Code.R ``` This\n is the R code that was used to run the simulations. Includes the actual\n simulation function plus some lines to manipulate and save the output.\n Note that the function is slow and is set up for parallel processing on a\n supercomputer, so use with caution. ``` #### 2. IndividualData.csv ```\n This is output showing characteristics of each simulated individual in\n each simulation run. This is a large dataset, in total there were 2.2\n million simulated individuals across the simulations. Details on the\n variables contained in this file below. These variables include both\n attributes assigned to the individual prior to the simulation as well as\n results of the simulation. ``` #### 3. NetworkData.csv ``` This is output\n containing summary statistics of the communication networks as well as the\n network parameters for each simulation run (40000 runs in total). Details\n on variables below. ``` #### 4. Figure2ANetwork.Rdata ``` An exemplar\n communication network. This is an igraph object so needs to be loaded\n after igraph package is loaded in R. This network was from a simulation\n run with the parameters: Chorus size = 10, no selective attention, hearing\n sensitivity = - 12 dB, no noise responsiveness. ``` #### 5.\n Figure2BNetwork.Rdata ``` Another exemplar communication network. This is\n an igraph object so needs to be loaded after igraph package is loaded in\n R. This network was from a simulation run with the parameters: Chorus size\n = 100, one competitor attended to, hearing sensitivity = 6 dB, no noise\n responsiveness. ``` #### 6. NoiseLevelsInChorus.csv ``` Dataset containing\n the sound pressure level in the center of the chorus for each simulation\n run. Details on variables below. ``` #### 7. Figure Preparation Script.Rmd\n ``` The R script used to prepare the figures. This loads up the data files\n listed above and processes them to produce the figures that are in both\n the main text and the supplement. This is an R markdown file, so the user\n may need to configure markdown to get this to work, and note that this is\n assuming the user is working in a Project in RStudio with all data files\n saved in the project folder. (see here for details on how to do that: )\n ``` Note that none of these files are the \"raw\" raw data. Raw\n output from the simulation runs include every single call given by every\n single individual. The total size of all of these files is 72.5 GB. We are\n unaware of any existing repository that can handle such a large file size.\n All of the files above contain summary statistics calculated from the raw\n data files. If any raw files are truly needed, please contact the\n corresponding author. ### Details for each data file. #### 2.\n IndividualData.csv -Each row represents an individual simulated in one\n simulation run Columns: FrogID - The individual's ID code within that\n simulation (note that codes were reused across simulations) XCor - The\n x-coordinate location of that individual on the chorus arena, in m\n (minimum value = 0, maximum value = 50). YCor - The y-coordinate location\n of that individual on the chorus arena, in m (minimum value = 0, maximum\n value = 50). BaselineCD - That individual's baseline call duration,\n in s. Amplitude - That individual's call amplitude, in dB. SNR - That\n individual's hearing sensitivity, in dB. InStrength - That\n individual's in-strength, based on the simulated communication\n network. Note that for analyses, we used the NormalizedInStrength, see\n below. OutStrength - That individual's in-strength, based on the\n simulated communication network. Note that for analyses, we used the\n NormalizedOutStrength, see below. EigenCentrality - That individual's\n eigenvector centrality in the simulated communication network (scaled to a\n maximum value of one). MeanObservedCD - That individual's mean call\n duration, averaged across all calls it gave during the simulation.\n NumberFrogs - Chorus size, number of individuals in the simulation.\n NumberAttended - Number of individuals attended to. Note that when there\n was no selective attention, this equalled the size of the chorus.\n MeanSignalNoiseRatio - The mean hearing sensitivity for that simulation\n run (-12, -6, 0, 6 dB). Calls had to be at least as loud as the background\n noise amplitude plus the hearing sensitivity to be heard and potentially\n influential on the receiver (therefore more negative values indicate more\n sensitive hearing). DistNetworkCentrality - That individual's\n eigenvector centrality in the spatial network (scaled to a maximum value\n of one). DeltaCentrality - The difference between the focal\n individual's eigenvector centrality in the communication network and\n its eigenvector centrality in the spatial network. Note that for graphs we\n multiplied this value by -1 in the graphing script to convert this as the\n centrality in the spatial network minus the centrality in the\n communication network (because it's more intuitive to interpret the\n graphs that way). NormalizedInStrength - The focal individual's\n in-strength, normalized by dividing edge weights by the average edge\n weight of the network, to allow for comparison across different simulated\n network sizes. NormalizedOutStrength - The focal individual's\n out-strength, normalized by dividing edge weights by the average edge\n weight of the network, to allow for comparison across different simulated\n network sizes. NoiseEffect - Whether or not the individual was responsive\n to noise (i.e. adjusted its calling behavior to the level of the\n background noise, regardless of whether any actual calls were heard). ####\n 3. NetworkData.csv -Each row represents a simulation run. Columns:\n NumberFrogs - Chorus size, number of individuals in the simulation.\n NumberAttended - Number of individuals attended to. Note that when there\n was no selective attention, this equalled the size of the chorus.\n MeanSignalNoiseRatio - The mean hearing sensitivity for that simulation\n run (-12, -6, 0, 6 dB). Calls had to be at least as loud as the background\n noise amplitude plus the hearing sensitivity to be heard and potentially\n influential on the receiver (therefore more negative values indicate more\n sensitive hearing). NoiseEffect - Whether or not the individual was\n responsive to noise (i.e. adjusted its calling behavior to the level of\n the background noise, regardless of whether any actual calls were heard).\n SelectiveAttention - If TRUE, individuals attended to only a subset of the\n most influential competitors who called in the interval since the focal\n individual's previous call, where the number of competitors attended\n to was given by the NumberAttended variable. EdgeDensity - The mean edge\n density in the network (the number of edges divided by all possible\n edges). MeanPathLength - the average of the shortest paths between all\n pairs of individuals in the chorus. Note that we used the\n NormalizedPathLength variable in analyses, not this one. See below.\n GrandMeanCallDuration - The average call duration across all calls given\n during the simulation run, in s. NormalizedPathLength - The path length\n calculated from a network where edge weights were normalized by the\n average edge weight in the network. NumberAttendedCat - The number of\n individuals attended to, but for simulations where there was no selective\n attention, these were given a value of \"5\" indicating that all\n competitors were attended to while accounting for the fact that different\n simulation runs had different maximum possible individuals attended to due\n to differences in chorus size. UniqueParameters - A helper variable for\n summary statistics, this is the chorus size, hearing sensitivity, number\n attended and noise responsiveness pasted together. #### 6.\n NoiseLevelsInChorus.csv -Each row represents a simulation run. ChorusSize\n - Chorus size, number of individuals in the simulation.\n NumberFrogsAttended - Number of individuals attended to. Note that when\n there was no selective attention, this equalled the size of the chorus.\n SNR - The mean hearing sensitivity for that simulation run (-12, -6, 0, 6\n dB). Calls had to be at least as loud as the background noise amplitude\n plus the hearing sensitivity to be heard and potentially influential on\n the receiver (therefore more negative values indicate more sensitive\n hearing). NoiseResponsiveness - Whether or not the individual was\n responsive to noise (i.e. adjusted its calling behavior to the level of\n the background noise, regardless of whether any actual calls were heard).\n NoiseSPL - The noise amplitude, in dB SPL, calculated from the centre of\n the chorus by sampling the noise level every 10 s and taking the\n root-mean-square of these values across the entire duration of the chorus."],"descriptionType":["TechnicalInfo"]}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":["https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.n8pk0p338"],"contentUrl":{},"metadataVersion":[2],"schemaVersion":["http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4"],"source":["mds"],"isActive":[true],"state":["findable"],"reason":{},"viewCount":[0],"downloadCount":[0],"referenceCount":[0],"citationCount":[1],"partCount":[0],"partOfCount":[0],"versionCount":[0],"versionOfCount":[0],"created":["2023-12-18T20:38:50Z"],"registered":["2023-12-18T20:38:51Z"],"published":{},"updated":["2024-07-08T14:49:01Z"]},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":["dryad.dryad"],"type":["clients"]}}}},{"id":["10.5281/zenodo.11402713"],"type":["dois"],"attributes":{"doi":["10.5281/zenodo.11402713"],"identifiers":[],"creators":[{"name":["Shatnawi,

demography of wildlife is vital to population monitoring;\n however, studies using physical capture methods can prove challenging.\n Camera traps have gained popularity as a density estimator tool in recent\n decades due to noninvasive data collection, reduced labor, cost\n efficiency, and large-scale monitoring capabilities. Many wildlife\n populations are comprised of individuals with no unique natural markers\n for individual identification, resulting in the need for unmarked\n abundance models. The recently developed Space-to-Event (STE) model offers\n a method for density estimation of unmarked populations using timelapse\n photography. STE relates detections of animals to camera sampling area\n (i.e., viewshed), resulting in density estimates that can be extrapolated\n to abundance over large areas. Consequently, this makes STE sensitive to\n estimates of viewshed area as small changes in viewshed could\n significantly affect density estimation. Using STE, we estimated density\n and recruitment of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in a densely\n forested landscape using measurements of viewshed per camera. We compared\n estimates of abundance derived from uniquely measured viewshed to\n estimates of abundance derived from an assumed viewshed area held constant\n across all cameras. When using a constant viewshed across all cameras, our\n point estimates of abundance shifted away from uniquely measured viewshed\n estimates in predictable ways, depending upon how much area was sampled.\n Additionally, we demonstrated the need for further exploration of animal\n availability at fine temporal scales by comparing estimates of density\n derived from sampling the full diel period to estimates derived from\n periods of peak activity (i.e., crepuscular periods). Finally, we extended\n the usefulness of the STE model by using densities of fawns and adult\n females to derive estimates of fawn recruitment."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["We collected photo data over two years (2021 and 2022) from two study\n sites (the James Collins Wildlife Management Area and the Sans Bois\n Wildlife Management Area) in southeast Oklahoma.

We outfitted each camera with a 32-gigabyte SD card programmed to\n take timelapse images at 10-minute intervals as well as motion-triggered\n images in bursts of three with no time delay between triggers. Once\n deployed, cameras synchronously took timelapse images to create\n instantaneous sampling occasions at each 10-minute timestep (i.e., 09:00,\n 09:10, 09:20, etc.).

However, variation in weapon form could also be the\n result of a weapon wearing out from usage. This mechanism has received\n relatively little attention. In this study, we demonstrate that sexually\n selected weapons can wear out from repeated use, providing experimental\n evidence that weapon usage can contribute to the diversity of weapon\n shapes observed within species. In a second experiment, we demonstrate\n that having a worn-out weapon decreases an individual’s fighting ability.\n This finding illustrates that the shape of a weapon can have an important\n role in determining contest outcomes.

There are two fastQ DNA sequence files, one for each direction of the sequence read, labeled with the accession identifier followed by an underscore and a number 1 or number 2, ie 6x_giganteus_1.fq.gz or 1993-1780_2.fq.gz, and the original MD5 hash text file that can be used to check file integrity after download. The file fastq.pdf, included with the dataset, provides additional general information about the fastq file type.

In grassland ecosystems, herbivores have\n the potential to greatly influence the survival, growth, and reproduction\n of plants. However, few studies examine interactions of above- and\n belowground grazing and AM mycorrhizal symbiosis on plant community\n structure. We established experimental mesocosms containing an assemblage\n of eight tallgrass prairie grass and forb species in native prairie soil,\n maintained under mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal conditions, with and\n without native herbivorous soil nematodes, and with and without\n grasshopper herbivory. Using factorial analysis of variance and principal\n component analysis, we examined: a) the independent and interacting\n effects of above- and belowground herbivores on AM symbiosis in tallgrass\n prairie mesocosms, b) independent and interacting effects of above- and\n belowground herbivores and mycorrhizal fungi on plant community structure,\n and c) potential influences of mycorrhizal responsiveness of host plants\n on herbivory tolerance, and concomitant shifts in plant community\n composition. Treatment effects were characterized by interactions between\n AM fungi and both aboveground and belowground herbivores, while herbivore\n effects were additive. The dominance of mycorrhizal-dependent C4 grasses\n in the presence of AMF symbiosis was increased (p &lt; 0.0001) by\n grasshopper herbivory but reduced (p &lt; 0.0001) by nematode\n herbivory. Cool-season C3 grasses exhibited a competitive release in the\n absence of AMF symbiosis but this effect was largely reversed in the\n presence of grasshopper herbivory. Forbs showed species-specific responses\n to both AM fungal inoculation and the addition of herbivores. Biomass of\n the grazing-avoidant, facultatively mycotrophic forb Brickellia\n eupatorioides increased (p &lt; 0.0001) in the absence of AMF\n symbiosis and with grasshopper herbivory, while AMF-related increases in\n the aboveground biomass of mycorrhizal-dependent forbs Rudbeckia hirta and\n Salvia azurea were eradicated (p &lt; 0.0001) by grasshopper\n herbivory. In contrast, nematode herbivory enhanced (p = 0.001) the\n contribution of Salvia azurea to total biomass. Synthesis: Our research\n indicates that AM symbiosis is the key driver of the dominance of C4\n grasses in the tallgrass prairie, with foliar and root herbivory being two\n mechanisms for the maintenance of plant diversity."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["Experimental tallgrass prairie plant communities were constructed and\n maintained in large mesocosms grown in a greenhouse facility at Kansas\n State University in Manhattan, KS, USA.

based on the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process have become standard for\n the comparative study of adaptation. Cooper et al. (2016) have cast doubt\n on this practice by claiming statistical problems with fitting\n Ornstein–Uhlenbeck models to comparative data. Specifically, they claim\n that statistical tests of Brownian motion may have too high Type I error\n rates and that such error rates are exacerbated by measurement error. In\n this note, we argue that these results have little relevance to the\n estimation of adaptation with Ornstein–Uhlenbeck models for three reasons.\n First, we point out that Cooper et al. (2016) did not consider the\n detection of distinct optima (e.g. for different environments), and\n therefore did not evaluate the standard test for adaptation. Second, we\n show that consideration of parameter estimates, and not just statistical\n significance, will usually lead to correct inferences about evolutionary\n dynamics. Third, we show that bias due to measurement error can be\n corrected for by standard methods. We conclude that Cooper et al. (2016)\n have not identified any statistical problems specific to\n Ornstein–Uhlenbeck models, and that their cautions against their use in\n comparative analyses are unfounded and misleading.

Bees were exposed to EtOH vapors for 0, 1, 2.5, or 5 min, and\n haemolymph was collected 1 min post EtOH exposure.

A recently introduced herbicide containing a mixture of\n clopyralid and aminopyralid (“CA”) is thought to be specific to honey\n mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) control. Our objective was to document the\n effects of CA alone and mixed with other brush herbicides, including\n picloram and triclopyr, on two target species, honey mesquite and\n pricklypear (Opuntia spp.), and two non-target woody plants, lotebush\n (Zizyphus obtusifolia) and hackberry (Celtis laevigata var reticulata).\n Treatments were 1) CA, 2) CA + triclopyr (CA+Tr), 3) CA + picloram\n (CA+Pc), and 4) clopyralid + triclopyr (Cp+Tr). We applied aerial spray\n treatments on four, 4-ha replicated plots of mature mesquite thickets that\n also contained pricklypear in each of 3 consecutive years in north-central\n Texas and evaluated plots at 1 year and 2 years post-treatment (YPT). We\n developed a tolerance-rating model with 5 levels (highly tolerant,\n tolerant, moderately tolerant, moderately susceptible, and susceptible)\n that integrated stand-level percent whole plant mortality (root-kill) and\n percent canopy reduction of surviving plants. Mesquite was susceptible to\n all treatments in all spray years. Pricklypear was susceptible to CA+Pc\n [root-kill more than doubled (33 to 84%) from 1 to 2 YPT], but highly\n tolerant of the other treatments. Lotebush was highly tolerant or tolerant\n of all treatments. Hackberry was tolerant of CA and Cp+Tr but susceptible\n to CA+Pc. The negative effect of CA+Pc on hackberry was greater when\n hackberry was drought-stressed.

However, because weather determines their\n hydrologic cycles, wetlands are highly vulnerable to the effects of\n climate change. Although changes in temperature and precipitation\n resulting from climate change are expected to reduce inundation of\n wetlands, few efforts have been made to quantify how these changes will\n influence availability of stopover sites for migratory wetland birds.\n Additionally, few studies have evaluated how climate change will influence\n inter-annual variability or the frequency of extremes in wetland\n availability. For spring and fall bird migration in 7 ecoregions in the\n south-central Great Plains of North America, we developed predictive\n models associating abundance of inundated wetlands with a suite of weather\n and landcover variables. We then used these models to generate predictions\n of wetland inundation at the end of the century (2069–2099) under future\n climate change scenarios. Climate models predicted the average number of\n inundated wetlands will likely decline during both spring and fall\n migration periods, with declines being greatest in the eastern ecoregions\n of the Great Plains. However, the magnitude of predicted declines varied\n considerably across climate models and ecoregions, with uncertainty among\n climate models being greatest in the High Plains ecoregion. Most\n ecoregions also were predicted to experience more-frequent extremely dry\n years (i.e., years with extremely low wetland abundances), but the\n projected change in inter-annual variability of wetland inundation was\n relatively small and varied across ecoregions and seasons. Because the\n south-central Great Plains represents an important link along the\n migratory routes of many wetland-dependent avian species, future declines\n in wetland inundation and more frequent periods of only a few wetlands\n being inundated. resulting in an uncertain future for migratory birds as\n they experience reduced availability of wetland stopover habitat across\n their migration pathways. "],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["We estimated the number of inundated wetlands in the southern Great Plains\n for each year from 1991–2020 using the USGS Dynamic Surface Water Extent\n Product.

Each row is associated with a 10x10 km grid cell/ year combination (each cell should occur 30 times, once for each year). Cell ID is recorded as FID\\_sample in the spreadsheet and the year is recorded in the year or y1 columns. The Latidude and Longitude of the centroid of each grid cell is recorded in the Lat, Long columns respectively. The number of inundated wetlands in each cell per year is recorded in the wet.num column, rows with NA indicate rows cells where no wetlands occur. Seasonal precipitation, mean temperature and maximum temperature and represented by the variables season\\*.ppt, season\\*.tmean, season.tmax where season\\* corresponds to fall, spring, summer, or winter in the excel sheet. precipitation balance is represented by bal3 (3-month precipitation balance), bal6 (6-month precipitation balance), and bal12 (12-month precipitation balance). Precipitation is in millimeters, temperature is in degrees Celsius and precipitation balance (bal3, bal6, bal12) is a unitless metric that represents the unstandardized difference between precipitation total and evapotranspiration potential. The TRI represents terrain roughness index which was calculated as the average difference between neighboring pixels in a 30 m resolution Digital Elevation Map of the southern Great Plains. The crop10, dev, tree, grass represent the percent cover of croplands, developed areas, forests, and grasslands respectively. All percent cover variables were derived from the USDA NASS cropland dataset.

Five years of grass production data were\n included in the mesquite cover/grass production regressions. Two years had\n extreme grass production responses, one due to drought and the other to\n high rainfall. Of the 3 remaining years, best-fit curves were negative\n linear for C4 short-grasses and C3 mid-grasses, and negative sigmoidal for\n C4 mid-grasses using both cover determination methods, although slopes of\n the curves differed between cover determination methods. C4 mid-grasses\n were more sensitive than the other grass groups to increasing mesquite\n cover. Loss of production potential when mesquite cover increased from\n 0–35% was 75.5, 28.7 and 23.2% for C4 mid-grasses, C3 mid-grasses and C4\n short-grasses, respectively.

Counterintuitively, however, invasive species effects\n are likely scale-dependent, and are hypothesized to be positively related\n to biodiversity at large spatial scales. Past studies investigating the\n effect of invasion on biodiversity have been mostly conducted at small\n scales (&lt;100 m2) that cannot represent large-dynamic landscapes by\n design. Therefore, replicated experimental evidence supporting a negative\n effect of invasive plants on biodiversity is lacking across many landscape\n types, including large grasslands. We collected data across eight large\n (333–809 ha) grassland landscapes managed with pyric herbivory—i.e., the\n recoupling of fire and grazing—to test how an invasive legume (Lespedeza\n cuneata) affected plant and bird communities at spatial grains ranging\n from 0.1 m2 to &gt;3,000,000 m2.

Synthesis and\n applications: Invasive species effects gleaned from small-scale studies\n may not reliably predict their effects at larger scales. Although we\n recognize the importance of small-scale studies in potentially isolating\n individual mechanisms, management strategies based solely on results from\n small-scale studies of invasion are unlikely to increase or conserve\n biodiversity across large landscapes. Rather, processes that generate\n landscape heterogeneity—like pyric herbivory—are probably more important\n for promoting biodiversity across all scales.

We sought to quantify population\n structure and hybridization and introgression in these three recently\n described species. Location Species-level diversity, particularly in the\n basin-restricted LRB and OB in the Ouachita Mountains within the Central\n Interior Highlands (CIH), North America, suggests the presence of distinct\n genetic variation that could be eroded by introgression.   Methods We\n estimated interspecific introgression and intraspecific population\n differentiation in the Smallmouth Bass species complex (SMB-C) using 472\n specimens comprising SMB, NB, LRB, and OB, including the naturally\n sympatric Spotted Bass (M. punctulatus; SPB). Genomic samples were\n genotyped on a SNP panel of 192 loci designed to detect allele-sharing on\n multiple hierarchical levels.  Results We found low range-wide\n hybridization between species in the SMB-C and SPB (mostly SMB-C\n backcrosses), and interspecific heterozygosity varied, indicating\n differential introgression.

(2023). In the home directory of the\n repository (SNOLH_Genomics), you will find a README.md file (the source\n script for this information), the R Project file (SNOLH_Genomics.Rproj),\n and three different \"analysis\" directories, each of which\n corresponds with a specific analysis conducted in our study: 1.\n 01_filtering_analysis 2. 02_structure_analysis 3. 03_introgress_analysis\n Within each analysis directory, you will find an R markdown script (.Rmd)\n with the name of the analysis, which contains all of the code needed to\n run the full analysis. Additionally, you will find: 1. code The code\n directory will store all source code, shell scripts, lists of bash\n commands, and software packages needed for analysis. Once you have\n downloaded the repository and located the code directory, you should\n create two additional sub-directories within each analysis (on the same\n level as the code directory): 1. data 2. figures The data directory will\n store all processed data and metadata needed for analysis. The figures\n folder will contain any raw figures generated in ggplot for each analysis.\n Ideally, the .Rmd script should have paths set up so that the code reads\n all data and scripts and generates figures seamlessly. ## Using the code\n To reproduce all analyses in Gunn et al. (2023), download this data\n repository and place in a desired home directory. This may be done on your\n local machine, but we recommend downloading to a high-performance\n computing cluster so that all code will run seamlessly in one environment,\n as long as Rstudio is installed and the GUI can be called on the cluster.\n Once all directories are downloaded, create a new sub-directory within the\n home directory (same level as the seven analysis directories, .Rproj,\n README.md, etc.) called `/raw_data`. This is where you will store the raw\n genomic data and associated sample metadata (see Data section below). ##\n Data Raw genotype data and accompanying metadata are available at\n Zenodo.org: [LINK] Download these data into to your `/raw_data` directory\n within the home working directory. You should have 2 new items in the\n directory: 1. snolh_genotype_data.xlsx 2. snolh_metadata.xlsx If you have\n any questions or issues with data and/or code, please don't hesitate\n to contact me: ## Analyses ### Analysis 1: Filtering Analysis In this\n analysis, we clean and filter the full genotype data for 487 black bass\n individuals, which was derived from the diagnostic SNP panel developed by\n Long et al. (2021) and prepare the data for analysis in Structure and\n NewHybrids (See Analysis 2). Specifically, we filter the dataset based on\n three criteria: 1) out poor quality SNP loci (loci that failed to genotype\n in over 20% of samples); 2) poor quality samples (samples that failed to\n genotype in over 20% of loci); and 3) potential duplicate samples (samples\n that are greater than 95% identical across loci). #### Follow the Code:\n `01_filtering_analysis/snolh_filtering_analysis.Rmd` ### Analysis 2:\n Population Structure and Hybrid Assignment In this analysis, we assess\n hierarchical population genomic structure among and within Interior\n Highland species using the diagnostic SNP panel published by Long et al.\n (2021). We begin with a holistic analysis of population structure among\n Spotted Bass and all other Interior Highland species (Smallmouth Bass,\n Neosho Bass, Ouachita Bass, and Little River Bass) and diagnose hybrids\n between these species using SNPs diagnostic for Spotted Bass. We then\n exclude detected hybrids and continue with an analysis of population\n structure and hybridization among Smallmouth Bass, Neosho Bass, Ouachita\n Bass and Little River Bass. We again exclude any detected hybrids and move\n on to a final analysis of all Interior Highland species, excluding Spotted\n Bass and Smallmouth Bass. #### Follow the Code:\n `02_structure_analysis/snolh_structure_analysis.Rmd` ### Analysis 3:\n Introgression Analysis In this analysis, we further investigate\n hybridization and introgression within populations that were inferred to\n contain hybrids based on NEWHYBRIDS analysis (Analysis 2). We use the R\n package Introgress to regress interspecific heterozygosity on hybrid index\n for inferred F1, F2, and back-cross individuals at each hierarchical level\n of hybrid analysis conducted in Analysis 2. With this analysis, we\n determine whether hybrids are of very recent origin (first or second\n generation) or if they show a genetic signature of deeper time\n hybridization. We also infer from this analysis the extent to which\n non-native alleles have introgressed into the native distribution of each\n Smallmouth Bass species complex (SMBC) species. #### Follow the Code:\n `03_introgress_analysis/snolh_introgress_analysis.Rmd`"],"descriptionType":["TechnicalInfo"]}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[{"funderName":["Oklahoma Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit*"]}],"url":["https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.k6djh9wbs"],"contentUrl":{},"metadataVersion":[4],"schemaVersion":["http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4"],"source":["mds"],"isActive":[true],"state":["findable"],"reason":{},"viewCount":[94],"downloadCount":[7],"referenceCount":[0],"citationCount":[1],"partCount":[0],"partOfCount":[0],"versionCount":[0],"versionOfCount":[0],"created":["2023-07-24T18:47:45Z"],"registered":["2023-07-24T18:47:46Z"],"published":{},"updated":["2024-04-11T08:28:47Z"]},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":["dryad.dryad"],"type":["clients"]}}}},{"id":["10.5061/dryad.7wm37pvz0"],"type":["dois"],"attributes":{"doi":["10.5061/dryad.7wm37pvz0"],"identifiers":[],"creators":[{"name":["Harris, Jonathan"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Jonathan"],"familyName":["Harris"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Iowa State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/04rswrd78"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[{"schemeUri":["https://orcid.org"],"nameIdentifier":["https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4428-903X"],"nameIdentifierScheme":["ORCID"]}]},{"name":["Harris, Jonathan"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Jonathan"],"familyName":["Harris"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["O'Connell, Timothy"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Timothy"],"familyName":["O'Connell"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]}],"titles":[{"title":["Mesopredator predation risk limits northern bobwhite nesting habitat"]}],"publisher":["Dryad"],"container":{},"publicationYear":[2023],"subjects":[{"subject":["FOS: Biological sciences"],"subjectScheme":["fos"]},{"subject":["FOS: Biological sciences"],"schemeUri":["http://www.oecd.org/science/inno/38235147.pdf"],"subjectScheme":["Fields of Science and Technology (FOS)"]},{"subject":["mesopredator"]},{"subject":["northern bobwhite"]}],"contributors":[],"dates":[{"date":["2023-04-03T00:00:00Z"],"dateType":["Issued"]},{"date":["2023-04-03T00:00:00Z"],"dateType":["Available"]}],"language":["en"],"types":{"ris":["DATA"],"bibtex":["misc"],"citeproc":["dataset"],"schemaOrg":["Dataset"],"resourceType":["dataset"],"resourceTypeGeneral":["Dataset"]},"relatedIdentifiers":[],"relatedItems":[],"sizes":[["372176 bytes"]],"formats":[],"version":["3"],"rightsList":[{"rights":["Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal"],"rightsUri":["https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode"],"schemeUri":["https://spdx.org/licenses/"],"rightsIdentifier":["cc0-1.0"],"rightsIdentifierScheme":["SPDX"]}],"descriptions":[{"description":["Predators can significantly limit the amount of available habitat for\n vulnerable prey.

diseases pose a significant threat to global health and\n biodiversity. Yet, predicting the spatiotemporal dynamics of wildlife\n epizootics remains challenging. Disease outbreaks result from complex\n non-linear interactions among a large collection of variables that rarely\n adhere to the assumptions of parametric regression modeling. We adopted a\n non-parametric machine learning approach to model wildlife epizootics and\n population recovery, using the disease system of colonial black-tailed\n prairie dogs (BTPD, Cynomys ludovicianus) and sylvatic plague as an\n example. We synthesized colony data between 2001–2020 from eight USDA\n Forest Service National Grasslands across the range of BTPD in central\n North America. We then modeled extinctions due to plague and colony\n recovery of BTPD in relation to complex interactions among climate,\n topoedaphic variables, colony characteristics, and disease history.\n Extinctions due to plague occurred more frequently when BTPD colonies were\n spatially clustered, in closer proximity to colonies decimated by plague\n during the previous year, following cooler than average temperatures the\n previous summer, and when wetter winter/springs were preceded by drier\n summer/falls. Rigorous cross-validations and spatial predictions indicated\n that our final models predicted plague outbreaks and colony recovery in\n BTPD with high accuracy (e.g., AUC generally &gt; 0.80). Thus, these\n spatially-explicit models can reliably predict the spatial and temporal\n dynamics of wildlife epizootics and subsequent population recovery in a\n highly complex host-pathogen system. Our models can be used to support\n strategic management planning (e.g., plague mitigation) to optimize\n benefits of this keystone species to associated wildlife communities and\n ecosystem functioning. This optimization can reduce conflicts among\n different landowners and resource managers, as well as economic losses to\n the ranching industry.

Maintaining landscape\n heterogeneity has been suggested as a potential conservation strategy to\n buffer animals from weather extremes. Because animal movement influences\n survival and population connectivity, understanding animal space use and\n movement in response to shifts in weather is useful for the conservation\n of wildlife. Non-migratory species are predicted to be more negatively\n affected by climate change because they have a limited ability to disperse\n to find resources. We studied the Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus;\n hereafter, bobwhite) to understand how weather alters habitat use and\n movement of a non-migratory animal across a landscape. We collected\n telemetry locations on bobwhite across western Oklahoma during 2019–2020\n and paired these data with meteorological and vegetation data. We analyzed\n the data at 2 temporal scales – hourly locations and 12-hour paths. At the\n hourly scale, we analyzed tree cover use, shrub cover use, and normalized\n difference vegetation index (NDVI) use using generalized or linear-mixed\n models. At the 12-hour scale, we calculated three different movement\n metrics: cumulative distance, net displacement, and sinuosity, and\n analyzed each movement metric separately using generalized linear-mixed\n models. We found that bobwhite used denser tree cover and higher NDVI\n values as air temperature increased in conjunction with solar radiation.\n Bobwhite used denser shrub cover as air temperature increased and average\n wind speed was high as well as when air temperature and average wind speed\n were low. The interaction between variability in vegetation and climate\n influenced bobwhite movement.

Trait evolution through natural selection can\n also vary across environments. However, whether the evolution of\n organismal performance is distinct between the sexes is rarely tested in a\n phylogenetic comparative context. Anurans commonly exhibit sexual size\n dimorphism, which may affect jumping performance given the effects of body\n size on locomotion. They also live in a wide variety of microhabitats. Yet\n the relationships among dimorphism, performance, and ecology remain\n underexamined in anurans. Here, we explore relationships between\n microhabitat use, body size, and jumping performance in males and females\n to determine the drivers of dimorphic patterns in jumping performance.\n Using methods for predicting jumping performance through anatomical\n measurements, we describe how fecundity selection and natural selection\n associated with body size and microhabitat have likely shaped female\n jumping performance. We found that the magnitude of sexual size dimorphism\n (where females are about 14% larger than males) was much lower than\n dimorphism in muscle volume, where females had 42% more muscle than males\n (after accounting for body size). Despite these sometimes-large averages,\n phylogenetic t-tests failed to show statistical significance of sexual\n dimorphism for any variable, indicating sexually dimorphic species tend to\n be closely related. While sexual dimorphism of jumping performance did not\n vary among microhabitats, we found female jumping velocity and energy\n differed across microhabitats. Overall, our findings indicate that\n differences in sex-specific reproductive roles, size, jumping-related\n morphology, and performance are all important determinants in how\n selection has led to the incredible ecophenotypic diversity in anurans."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["This dataset consists of sex identifications, individual linear\n measurements, body mass, estimates of leg muscle volume of many species\n obtained from museum specimens, and museum id and tag information.

movement patterns are affected by complex interactions between\n biotic and abiotic landscape conditions, and these patterns are being\n altered by weather variability associated with a changing

Some\n animals, like the American plains bison (Bison bison L.; hereafter, plains\n bison), are considered keystone species, thus their response to weather\n variability may alter ecosystem structure and biodiversity patterns. Many\n movement studies of plains bison and other ungulates have focused on\n point‐pattern analyses (e.g., resource‐selection) that have provided\n information about where these animals move, but information about when or\n why these animals move is limited. For example, information surrounding\n the influence of weather on plains bison movement in response to weather\n is limited but has important implications for their conservation in a\n changing climate. To explore how movement distance is affected by weather\n patterns and drought, we utilized 12‐min GPS data from two of the largest\n plains bison herds in North America to model their response to weather and\n drought parameters using generalized additive mixed models. Distance moved\n was best predicted by air temperature, wind speed, and rainfall. However,\n air temperature best explained the variation in distance moved compared to\n any other single parameter we measured, predicting a 48% decrease in\n movement rates above 28°C. Moreover, severe drought (as indicated by 25‐cm\n depth soil moisture) better predicted movement distance than moderate\n drought. The strong influence of weather and drought on plains bison\n movements observed in our study suggests that shifting climate and weather\n patterns will likely affect plains bison movement patterns, further\n complicating conservation efforts for this wide‐ranging keystone species.\n Moreover, changes in plains bison movement patterns may have cascading\n effects for grassland ecosystem structure, function, and biodiversity.\n Plains bison and grassland conservation efforts need to be proactive and\n adaptive when considering the implications of a changing climate on bison\n movement patterns."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[{"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"funderName":["The Nature Conservancy"],"funderIdentifier":["https://ror.org/0563w1497"],"funderIdentifierType":["ROR"]}],"url":["https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.547d7wmcq"],"contentUrl":{},"metadataVersion":[3],"schemaVersion":["http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4"],"source":["mds"],"isActive":[true],"state":["findable"],"reason":{},"viewCount":[100],"downloadCount":[7],"referenceCount":[0],"citationCount":[1],"partCount":[0],"partOfCount":[0],"versionCount":[0],"versionOfCount":[0],"created":["2022-12-04T23:47:34Z"],"registered":["2022-12-04T23:47:35Z"],"published":{},"updated":["2024-04-11T07:10:03Z"]},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":["dryad.dryad"],"type":["clients"]}}}},{"id":["10.5061/dryad.rn8pk0pfw"],"type":["dois"],"attributes":{"doi":["10.5061/dryad.rn8pk0pfw"],"identifiers":[],"creators":[{"name":["Love, Ashley"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Ashley"],"familyName":["Love"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of Connecticut"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/02der9h97"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[{"schemeUri":["https://orcid.org"],"nameIdentifier":["https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7144-7884"],"nameIdentifierScheme":["ORCID"]}]},{"name":["Anthony, Anna"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Anna"],"familyName":["Anthony"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Nash, Aimee"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Aimee"],"familyName":["Nash"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Campos-Melara, Angel"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Angel"],"familyName":["Campos-Melara"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of Arkansas System"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/05vvhh982"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Kodali, Jahnavi"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Jahnavi"],"familyName":["Kodali"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of Arkansas System"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/05vvhh982"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["DuRant, Sarah"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Sarah"],"familyName":["DuRant"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of Arkansas System"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/05vvhh982"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]}],"titles":[{"title":["Simulated infection alters the behavior of pair bonded songbirds and their healthy neighbors"]}],"publisher":["Dryad"],"container":{},"publicationYear":[2022],"subjects":[{"subject":["FOS: Biological sciences"],"subjectScheme":["fos"]},{"subject":["FOS: Biological sciences"],"schemeUri":["http://www.oecd.org/science/inno/38235147.pdf"],"subjectScheme":["Fields of Science and Technology (FOS)"]}],"contributors":[],"dates":[{"date":["2022-11-16T00:00:00Z"],"dateType":["Issued"]},{"date":["2022-11-16T00:00:00Z"],"dateType":["Available"]}],"language":["en"],"types":{"ris":["DATA"],"bibtex":["misc"],"citeproc":["dataset"],"schemaOrg":["Dataset"],"resourceType":["dataset"],"resourceTypeGeneral":["Dataset"]},"relatedIdentifiers":[],"relatedItems":[],"sizes":[["115581 bytes"]],"formats":[],"version":["4"],"rightsList":[{"rights":["Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal"],"rightsUri":["https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode"],"schemeUri":["https://spdx.org/licenses/"],"rightsIdentifier":["cc0-1.0"],"rightsIdentifierScheme":["SPDX"]}],"descriptions":[{"description":["While infection and perceived infection risk can influence social and\n reproductive behavior in several taxa, relatively little is known about\n how infection specifically affects pair bond behaviors.

Our study suggests complex weather effects never before\n considered in the context of bird collisions, including possible time lag\n effects of conditions two and three nights before collisions occur,\n effects of multi-day sequences of conditions, and interactions between\n conditions at different times of the night. More research is needed to\n determine if the accuracy of weather-based collision prediction systems\n improves by integrating such nuances and to clarify mechanisms through\n which these complex effects operate, such as influences of weather on\n migration intensity and collision avoidance behavior.

Low taxon sampling and taxonomic uncertainties still obscure our\n evolutionary knowledge of many taxa, especially widespread lineages across\n diverse landscapes. Of particular interest are those lineages inhabiting\n seasonal and arid landscapes, which showcase unique distributional\n patterns that hint at fascinating histories. Using the most comprehensive\n sampling to date of a widespread bulbous monocot, we hypothesize two\n independent dispersals to Madagascar, and that vicariance due to\n Miocene-driven aridification contracted a once-widespread distribution\n between Africa and Eurasia. Location Sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar,\n Eurasia Taxon Ledebouriinae (Scilloideae, Asparagaceae) Methods Using the\n Angiosperms353 probe set for 195 taxa (86 ingroup taxa), we perform\n phylogenetic reconstruction using IQ-Tree, and we infer age estimates\n using penalized likelihood as implemented in treePL. Capitalizing on our\n broad geographic sampling, which includes African, Malagasy, and Eurasian\n taxa, we use ‘BioGeoBEARS’ to reconstruct ancestral ranges and investigate\n the role of vicariance and dispersal.  Results The Ledebouriinae\n originated within the past ~30 myr in southeastern sub-Saharan Africa,\n with the major subclades arising soon thereafter. Although long-distance\n dispersal cannot be fully ruled out, we argue that vicariance was the\n major process responsible for the current distribution of Ledebouria in\n Eurasia. We recover two distinct Ledebouria groups that overlap in eastern\n Africa, but are divided into mostly northern and southern clades with\n divergent biogeographical histories, each showing an independent dispersal\n to Madagascar. A similar north-south split is seen in Drimiopsis.\n Additionally, we recover a complex biogeographic history in the\n predominantly sub-Saharan African Ledebouria clade, with a rapid radiation\n at ~14 mya. Main conclusions The expansion of seasonal rainfall and\n aridity in sub-Saharan Africa, coupled with orogenic activity, may have\n fostered the diversification of the Ledebouriinae and many subclades.\n Miocene-driven aridification may have caused fragmentation of a once\n widespread distribution that led to their occurrence in Eurasia."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":["https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.r4xgxd2gw"],"contentUrl":{},"metadataVersion":[4],"schemaVersion":["http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4"],"source":["mds"],"isActive":[true],"state":["findable"],"reason":{},"viewCount":[115],"downloadCount":[18],"referenceCount":[0],"citationCount":[2],"partCount":[0],"partOfCount":[0],"versionCount":[0],"versionOfCount":[0],"created":["2023-04-13T22:37:00Z"],"registered":["2023-04-13T22:37:01Z"],"published":{},"updated":["2024-04-11T06:17:29Z"]},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":["dryad.dryad"],"type":["clients"]}}}},{"id":["10.25338/b87647"],"type":["dois"],"attributes":{"doi":["10.25338/b87647"],"identifiers":[],"creators":[{"name":["LoPresti, Eric"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Eric"],"familyName":["LoPresti"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of South Carolina"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/02b6qw903"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Pan, Vincent"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Vincent"],"familyName":["Pan"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Michigan State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/05hs6h993"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[{"schemeUri":["https://orcid.org"],"nameIdentifier":["https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9892-7805"],"nameIdentifierScheme":["ORCID"]}]},{"name":["Girvin, Cecilia"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Cecilia"],"familyName":["Girvin"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of California, Santa Cruz"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/03s65by71"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Barber, Gabhriel"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Gabhriel"],"familyName":["Barber"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Jaeger, Sierra"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Sierra"],"familyName":["Jaeger"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of South Carolina"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/02b6qw903"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Orrock, John"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["John"],"familyName":["Orrock"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of Wisconsin-Madison"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01y2jtd41"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]}],"titles":[{"title":["Sandy seeds: Armor or invisibility cloak?

Finally, we reconstructed ancestral\n states for ecologically-important traits under a Brownian motion model on\n phylogenetic networks implemented in PhyloNetworks and then tested for\n transgressive evolution in these traits. "],"descriptionType":["Methods"]}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[{"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"funderName":["National Science Foundation"],"awardNumber":["1542534"],"funderIdentifier":["https://ror.org/021nxhr62"],"funderIdentifierType":["ROR"]}],"url":["https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.6078/D15M69"],"contentUrl":{},"metadataVersion":[6],"schemaVersion":["http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4"],"source":["mds"],"isActive":[true],"state":["findable"],"reason":{},"viewCount":[167],"downloadCount":[27],"referenceCount":[0],"citationCount":[0],"partCount":[0],"partOfCount":[0],"versionCount":[0],"versionOfCount":[0],"created":["2023-01-25T19:36:16Z"],"registered":["2023-01-25T19:36:17Z"],"published":{},"updated":["2024-04-11T05:19:51Z"]},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":["dryad.dryad"],"type":["clients"]}}}},{"id":["10.5061/dryad.pzgmsbcpx"],"type":["dois"],"attributes":{"doi":["10.5061/dryad.pzgmsbcpx"],"identifiers":[],"creators":[{"name":["Duchardt, Courtney"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Courtney"],"familyName":["Duchardt"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[{"schemeUri":["https://orcid.org"],"nameIdentifier":["https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4563-0199"],"nameIdentifierScheme":["ORCID"]}]}],"titles":[{"title":["Associated data for: Disease and weather induce rapid shifts in a rangeland ecosystem mediated by a keystone species (Cynomys ludovicianus)"]}],"publisher":["Dryad"],"container":{},"publicationYear":[2022],"subjects":[{"subject":["disturbance"]},{"subject":["grassland birds"]},{"subject":["Great Plains"]},{"subject":["Mesocarnivore"]},{"subject":["mountain plover"]},{"subject":["prairie dog"]},{"subject":["Ungulate"]},{"subject":["Ordination"]},{"subject":["multi-species"]},{"subject":["grassland"]},{"subject":["Camera"]},{"subject":["FOS: Biological sciences"],"subjectScheme":["fos"]},{"subject":["FOS: Biological sciences"],"schemeUri":["http://www.oecd.org/science/inno/38235147.pdf"],"subjectScheme":["Fields of Science and Technology (FOS)"]}],"contributors":[],"dates":[{"date":["2022-06-14T00:00:00Z"],"dateType":["Issued"]},{"date":["2022-06-14T00:00:00Z"],"dateType":["Available"]}],"language":["en"],"types":{"ris":["DATA"],"bibtex":["misc"],"citeproc":["dataset"],"schemaOrg":["Dataset"],"resourceType":["dataset"],"resourceTypeGeneral":["Dataset"]},"relatedIdentifiers":[],"relatedItems":[],"sizes":[["1887812 bytes"]],"formats":[],"version":["3"],"rightsList":[{"rights":["Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal"],"rightsUri":["https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode"],"schemeUri":["https://spdx.org/licenses/"],"rightsIdentifier":["cc0-1.0"],"rightsIdentifierScheme":["SPDX"]}],"descriptions":[{"description":["Habitat loss and changing climate have direct impacts on native species\n but can also interact with disease pathogens to influence wildlife\n communities. In the North American Great Plains, black-tailed prairie dogs\n (Cynomys ludovicianus) are a keystone species that create important\n grassland habitat for numerous species and serve as prey for predators,\n but lethal control driven by agricultural conflict has severely reduced\n their abundance. Novel disease dynamics caused by epizootic plague\n (Yersinia pestis) within prairie dog colonies have further reduced prairie\n dog abundances, in turn destabilizing associated wildlife communities. We\n capitalized on a natural experiment — collecting data on prairie dog\n distributions, vegetation structure, avian abundance, and mesocarnivore\n and ungulate occupancy before (2015–2017) and after (2018–2019) a plague\n event in northeastern Wyoming, USA. Plague decimated black-tailed prairie\n dog populations in what was then the largest extant colony complex,\n reducing colony cover in the focal area from over 10,000 ha to less than\n 50 ha. We documented dramatic declines in mesocarnivore occupancy and\n raptor abundance post-plague, with probability of occupancy or abundance\n approaching zero in species that rely on prairie dogs for a high\n proportion of their diet (e.g., ferruginous hawk [Buteo regalis], American\n badger [Taxidea taxus], and swift fox [Vulpes velox]). Following the\n plague outbreak, abnormally high precipitation in 2018 hastened vegetation\n recovery from prairie dog disturbance on colonies where constant herbivory\n had formerly maintained shortgrass structure necessary for certain\n colony-associates. As a result, we observed large shifts in avian\n communities on former prairie dog colonies, including near-disappearance\n of mountain plovers (Charadrius montanus) and increases in mid-grass\n associated songbirds (e.g., lark bunting [Calamospiza melanocorys]). Our\n research highlights how precipitation can interact with disease-induced\n loss of a keystone species to induce drastic and rapid shifts in wildlife\n communities. Although grassland taxa co-evolved with high spatiotemporal\n variation, fragmentation of remaining North American rangelands paired\n with higher-than-historical variability in climate and disease dynamics\n are likely to destabilize these systems in the future."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["File includes five data sheets/tabs.

However, no study has synthesized this literature on cat\n impacts on wildlife to evaluate its overarching biases and major gaps. To\n direct future research and conservation related to cat impacts on\n wildlife, we conducted a global literature review that entailed evaluation\n and synthesis of patterns and gaps in the literature related to the\n geographic context, methods, and types of impacts studied. Our systematic\n literature search compiled 2,245 publications. We extracted information\n from 332 of these meeting inclusion criteria designed to ensure the\n relevance of studies analyzed. This synthesis of research on cat impacts\n on wildlife highlights a focus on oceanic islands, Australia, Europe, and\n North America, and on rural areas, predation, impacts of unowned cats, and\n impacts at population and species levels. Key research advances needed to\n better understand and manage cat impacts include more studies in\n underrepresented, highly biodiverse regions (Africa, Asia, South America),\n on cat impacts other than predation, and on methods designed to reduce\n impacts on wildlife.

underground often leads to animals having specialized auditory\n systems to accommodate the constraints of acoustic transmission in\n tunnels. Despite living underground, naked mole-rats use a highly vocal\n communication system, implying that they rely on central auditory\n processing. However, little is known about these animals’ central auditory\n system, and whether it follows a similar developmental time course as\n other rodents. Naked mole-rats show slowed development in the hippocampus\n suggesting they have altered brain development compared to other rodents.\n Here, we measured morphological characteristics and voltage-gated\n potassium channel Kv3.3 expression and protein levels at different key\n developmental time points (postnatal days 9, 14, 21, and adulthood) to\n determine whether the auditory brainstem (lateral superior olive (LSO) and\n medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB)), develops similarly to two\n common auditory rodent model species: gerbils and mice. Additionally, we\n measured the hearing onset of naked mole-rats using auditory brainstem\n response (ABR) recordings at the same developmental timepoints. In\n contrast to other work in naked mole-rats showing that they are highly\n divergent in many aspects of their physiology, we show that naked\n mole-rats have a similar hearing onset, between P9-P14, to many other\n rodents.

Additional images were taken using a Zeiss (Jena, Germany) LSM\n 980 with Airyscan2 (1024 x 1024 pixel) at 20X (NA 0.8). The MNTB and LSO\n were characterized by their morphology, location and position in the\n trapezoid body and superior olive, and by the shape and size of neurons\n within these nuclei. Specifically, sections were cut from posterior –\n anterior and the 7th nerve and cochlear nuclei used as a reference for\n location of the MNTB and LSO. A montage, covering an extended field of\n view, was captured by imaging multiple 20X tiles and stitching them\n together using the Olympus FV10-ASW acquisition software. ABR measurements\n and analysis methods are described in previous publications. Naked\n mole-rats were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine-xylazine (100mg/kg,\n 10mg/kg respectively) administered via intraperitoneal injections.

To better understand how diel and seasonal rhythms\n affect animals, we evaluated movements of Northern Bobwhite (Colinus\n virginianus); hereafter, bobwhite. Because bobwhite are a small\n non-migratory species that must cope with daily and seasonal changes in\n their environment year-around, they are a model species to study how diel\n and seasonal rhythms influence animal movement of a non-migratory species.\n Global positioning system data from transmitters attached to bobwhite at\n four wildlife management sites across Oklahoma were collected during\n 2019–2021. We parsed the diel data as daytime (7:00–19:00 Central Daylight\n Savings Time [CDT]) and nighttime (19:00–7:00 CDT), and diurnal\n (sunrise–sunset) and nocturnal (sunset–sunrise) as well as by astronomical\n season. We calculated three movement metrics: net displacement (Euclidean\n distance from the starting fix to the ending fix of a path which\n encompasses consecutive relocations in a time series of geographic fixes),\n cumulative distance (sum of all Euclidean distances between each\n consecutive fix along the path), and hourly movement. We modeled the data\n using a generalized linear mixed-modeling approach. Across season, model\n predictions showed that net displacement was highest during spring, and\n daytime cumulative distance slowly increased as the year progressed.\n Bobwhite had two movement peaks during the diurnal period, one during\n 9:00–10:00 and the other during 17:00–20:00 depending on the season.\n Despite being diurnal, bobwhite occasionally made nocturnal movements,\n likely in response to a disturbance by a predator, inclement weather, or\n energetic demands. Movement peaks during the diurnal period may reflect\n changes in behavior in response to energy requirements, predator risk, and\n changes in air temperature. Life history events, likely cause seasonal\n differences in movement. This study furthers our understanding on how\n animals move daily and seasonally suggesting the importance of analyzing\n movement across the entire year because animals move differently across\n the day and year."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[{"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"funderName":["Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation"],"funderIdentifier":["https://ror.org/00bnq0b88"],"funderIdentifierType":["ROR"]},{"funderName":["Hatch Program funding*"],"awardNumber":["OKL03193"]},{"funderName":["Groendyke Endowement*"]},{"funderName":["Bollenbach Endowment*"]}],"url":["https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.cvdncjt6f"],"contentUrl":{},"metadataVersion":[4],"schemaVersion":["http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4"],"source":["mds"],"isActive":[true],"state":["findable"],"reason":{},"viewCount":[82],"downloadCount":[3],"referenceCount":[0],"citationCount":[1],"partCount":[0],"partOfCount":[0],"versionCount":[0],"versionOfCount":[0],"created":["2022-04-29T18:41:25Z"],"registered":["2022-04-29T18:41:26Z"],"published":{},"updated":["2024-04-11T04:20:24Z"]},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":["dryad.dryad"],"type":["clients"]}}}},{"id":["10.5061/dryad.hx3ffbggp"],"type":["dois"],"attributes":{"doi":["10.5061/dryad.hx3ffbggp"],"identifiers":[],"creators":[{"name":["Morinaga, Gen"],"nameType":["Personal"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[{"schemeUri":["https://orcid.org"],"nameIdentifier":["https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1120-0043"],"nameIdentifierScheme":["ORCID"]}]},{"name":["Wiens, John"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["John"],"familyName":["Wiens"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of Arizona"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/03m2x1q45"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Moen, Daniel"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Daniel"],"familyName":["Moen"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of California, Riverside"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/03nawhv43"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]}],"titles":[{"title":["Dataset for: The radiation continuum and the evolution of frog diversity"]}],"publisher":["Dryad"],"container":{},"publicationYear":[2022],"subjects":[{"subject":["FOS: Biological sciences"],"subjectScheme":["fos"]},{"subject":["FOS: Biological sciences"],"schemeUri":["http://www.oecd.org/science/inno/38235147.pdf"],"subjectScheme":["Fields of Science and Technology (FOS)"]},{"subject":["adaptive radiation"]},{"subject":["Phylogenetic analysis"],"schemeUri":["https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus"],"subjectScheme":["PLOS Subject Area Thesaurus"]},{"subject":["Comparative Biology"]},{"subject":["Anura"]},{"subject":["Frogs"],"schemeUri":["https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus"],"subjectScheme":["PLOS Subject Area Thesaurus"]},{"subject":["Toads"],"schemeUri":["https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus"],"subjectScheme":["PLOS Subject Area Thesaurus"]},{"subject":["Diversification"]},{"subject":["Morphology"]},{"subject":["Herpetology"]}],"contributors":[],"dates":[{"date":["2023-11-07T00:00:00Z"],"dateType":["Issued"]},{"date":["2023-11-07T00:00:00Z"],"dateType":["Available"]}],"language":["en"],"types":{"ris":["DATA"],"bibtex":["misc"],"citeproc":["dataset"],"schemaOrg":["Dataset"],"resourceType":["dataset"],"resourceTypeGeneral":["Dataset"]},"relatedIdentifiers":[{"relationType":["IsCitedBy"],"relatedIdentifier":["10.1038/s41467-023-42745-x"],"relatedIdentifierType":["DOI"]},{"relationType":["IsDerivedFrom"],"relatedIdentifier":["10.5281/zenodo.8422404"],"relatedIdentifierType":["DOI"]}],"relatedItems":[],"sizes":[["1351872531 bytes"]],"formats":[],"version":["5"],"rightsList":[{"rights":["Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal"],"rightsUri":["https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode"],"schemeUri":["https://spdx.org/licenses/"],"rightsIdentifier":["cc0-1.0"],"rightsIdentifierScheme":["SPDX"]}],"descriptions":[{"description":["Most of life’s vast diversity of species and phenotypes is often\n attributed to adaptive radiation.

Climate is comprised of many\n variables including air temperature, barometric pressure, solar radiation,\n wind, relative humidity, and precipitation that interact with each other.\n As movement connects various aspects of an animal’s life, understanding\n how climate influences movement at a fine-temporal scale will be critical\n to the long-term conservation of species impacted by climate change. The\n sedentary nature of non-migratory species could increase some species risk\n of extirpation caused by climate change. We used Northern Bobwhite\n (Colinus virginianus; hereafter bobwhite) as a model to better understand\n the relationship between climate and the movement ecology of a\n non-migratory species at a fine-temporal scale. We collected movement data\n on bobwhite from across western Oklahoma during 2019–2020 and paired these\n data with meteorological data. We analyzed movement three different ways\n (probability of movement, hourly distance moved, and sinuosity) using two\n calculated movement metrics: hourly movement (displacement between two\n consecutive fixes an hour apart) and sinuosity (a form of tortuosity that\n determines the amount of curvature of a random search path). We used\n generalized linear-mixed models to analyze probability of movement and\n hourly distance moved, and used linear-mixed models o analyze sinuosity.\n The interaction between air temperature and solar radiation affected\n probability of movement and hourly distance moved.

During spring migration, ≥80% of significant changes in\n the timing of spring peak indicated advancements, while 67% of significant\n changes in autumn peak timing indicated delays both across years and with\n increasing temperatures. Four refuges showed a consistent pattern across\n species of advancing spring migration peaks over time. Advancements in\n spring peak across years became proportionally less common among species\n with increasing latitude, while delays in autumn peak with increasing\n temperature became proportionally more common.

Animals may respond\n negatively to supplemental feeding if the artificial food source increases\n disease risk due to aggregation. We manipulated supplemental food\n availability in a wild population of Eastern bluebirds, Sialia sialis, to\n examine the influence on physiological metrics and nesting success without\n causing birds to aggregate to access food. Adult and nestling bluebirds\n were randomly assigned to one of three feeding groups.

This indicates Eastern bluebirds are not significantly impacted\n by supplemental mealworm feeding during breeding, at least when natural\n food sources are abundant. Removal of a supplemental food source during\n breeding also did not influence bluebird productivity. Bird feeding by\n hobbyists may attract birds to locations with available nesting sites\n without demonstrably negative or positive effects."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["Field methods: The range of Eastern bluebirds extends from the central\n United States to the Atlantic Coast (Sibley et al., 2014). Bluebirds\n prefer to nest in edge habitats, including edges created by human\n development, which brings them into close contact with humans (Jones et\n al., 2014). Eastern bluebirds are secondary cavity nesters, and breed in\n artificial nest cavities. For this study, nest boxes (2015: n = 187, 2016:\n n = 176) located along walking trails and roads in Stillwater, Oklahoma\n (36°7′18″N 97°4′7″W) were utilized to manipulate the food available to\n breeding Eastern bluebirds. Nest boxes were checked 2-3 times weekly\n throughout the breeding season during March-August in 2015 and 2016.\n Individual boxes were monitored daily when complete nests were detected to\n determine first egg dates. Boxes were again monitored daily when clutches\n were within two days of their expected hatch date (clutch completion date\n + 13 days). Then nest boxes were monitored during regular nest checks to\n determine if fledging occurred. This frequency of monitoring generally\n follows methods used previously in this population (Author et al., 2012).\n Experimental manipulation of food availability: Small feeding cups (2 oz.,\n plastic) were mounted in all nest boxes prior to the breeding season. In\n these cups, supplemental food was provided by adding fifteen mealworms\n (1.909 ± 0.177g) per individual bluebird in the nest box, including both\n adults and nestlings, three times per week (~11.4 – 40 g weekly) (Smith,\n 2021). Each time the nest boxes were visited, it was noted whether the\n cups were empty or contained mealworms to track if the birds had consumed\n them. Any nest boxes with consistently full cups, likely neophobic\n individuals or recently failed nests, were removed from all analyses\n (9.53% of 63 boxes total for both years which received PART/FULL\n treatments and survived to day 5). All boxes included in the analyses\n consumed greater than half of all mealworms provided to them. The\n experimental groups were randomly allocated to FULL (2015: n = 35, 2016: n\n = 22), PART (2015: n = 26, 2016: n = 20) or CONT (2015: n = 36, 2016: n =\n 35) treatment groups. An additional subset of boxes was included as a\n control for potential effects of additional foot traffic at the boxes. The\n boxes in this second control group did not receive supplemental food and\n were visited only 2-3 times per week during regular nest monitoring. All\n other boxes, regardless of experimental treatment, were visited and opened\n the same number of times to control for any effects of disturbance.\n Because the two control groups did not differ significantly in any of the\n main effects (all p &gt; 0.058), these groups were combined in the\n analyses described below. Morphology: All adult birds in the study were\n captured for banding and weighing using a nest box trap no sooner than two\n days after nestlings hatched (Friedman et al., 2008). Mass for each\n individual was determined using either a digital balance (accuracy=0.01 g)\n or Pesola (accuracy=0.1 g). Nestlings were weighed on day 14 post-hatch\n (day 0=hatch day). Nestlings were banded with an aluminum USFWS band on\n day 11 post-hatch, and were examined to determine sex based on plumage\n coloration on day 14 (Pyle 1997). Nest Success: A clutch was considered\n complete when the number of eggs did not increase for more than one day.\n Hatching success was quantified as the proportion of eggs in the clutch\n that hatched. Fledging success was determined as the proportion of\n nestlings that left the nest after the day 14 measurement. The typical\n time to fledging in Eastern bluebirds is 17-19 days (Gowaty and Plissner,\n 2015) with nestlings capable of weak flight at day 14. Nestlings absent\n from the nest after day 14 were considered successfully fledged, unless\n there was evidence of death or predation. Blood Sampling and Laboratory\n Methods: Blood samples (50-100 µL) were collected from all nestlings and\n adults within three minutes of removal from the nest box to determine CORT\n levels (Owen, 2011). Compared to other studies on this population in which\n CORT has been measured, CORT levels in this study were elevated (Author et\n al. 2012). In this study, we collected blood samples within three minutes\n of removal from the nest box, rather than within three minutes of initial\n disturbance, as in previous studies. All blood samples were taken between\n 0700-1100 hours to minimize variation due to circadian rhythms in hormone\n levels (Remage-Healey and Romero, 2000). Approximately 5-10 µl of each\n whole blood sample was used to prepare blood smears in the field. The\n remainder of each whole blood sample was kept cool on ice until it was\n brought to the laboratory for plasma separation with a centrifuge at 1846\n xg for seven minutes, which took place within 4 hours of collection.\n Plasma was stored at -20°C until it was used in BKA assays, or to measure\n plasma CORT. Average storage length prior to BKA analysis was 158±3.37\n days. Storage length was not significantly related to BKA; therefore, we\n did not include this as a covariate in our analyses (t(76)=2.28, p =\n 0.99). Storage length also was not significantly related to CORT levels;\n therefore, we did not include this as a covariate in our analyses (t(276)\n =0.055, p = 0.956). Slides were stained with Differential Quik Stain\n following kit instructions (Triangle Biomedical Sciences; Davis et al.,\n 2008). A complete blood cell count was performed following the techniques\n described in Avian and Exotic Animal Hematology and Cytology (Campbell and\n Ellis, 2013, Clark et al., 2009) by an expert in white blood cell\n identification (IK) who was blind to the identity of the treatment groups.\n Heterophil to lymphocyte (H:L) ratios were calculated by dividing the\n total number of heterophils by the total number of lymphocytes. Enzyme\n immunoassays (Corticosterone ELISA Kit ADI-901-097, Enzo Life Sciences)\n were used to quantify circulating plasma CORT levels. Based on previous\n optimization of the assay for Eastern bluebirds (unpubl. data), plasma\n samples were diluted 1:40 in 1.5% steroid displacement reagent (SDR). All\n samples were run in duplicate and the corticosterone standards (20,000,\n 4,000, 800, 500, 160, and 32 pg/mL) were run in triplicate. The optical\n density of the plates was then read at 405 nm on a BioTek ELx808\n microplate reader. Samples with intra-assay coefficients of variation\n (CVs) higher than 15% were re-run (average intra-assay CV: 6.25%). The\n average inter-assay CV was 14.57%. Tryptic soy agar (Fisher Scientific,\n DF0369-17-6) plates were made under sterile conditions and stored at 4°C\n the day prior to conducting BKA assays. Escherichia coli (ATCC #8739,\n Microbiologics) stocks and dilutions were prepared the day before assays\n were conducted. E. coli stock solutions were prepared by adding one\n lyophilized bacteria pellet (5.6 x 107 CFU) to 40 mL of phosphate-buffered\n saline (Sigma Aldrich, P-5368), which was then incubated at 37°C for 30\n minutes and stored at 4°C. Plasma and bacteria were incubated in carbon\n dioxide independent media (Invitrogen Inc, Gibco media #18045).\n Additionally, 200 µL of 200 mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies, 25030-149)\n was added to the solution prior to incubation. To perform the assay, 5 µL\n of plasma was combined with 100 µL of the media solution and 10 µL of\n bacterial working solution. The bacteria and plasma were incubated\n together for 30 minutes at 41°C. The samples were then plated on agar\n plates and incubated for a minimum of 12 hours at 37°C. Control plates\n were prepared in the same manner as experimental plates; however, control\n plates did not contain plasma. The number of colonies on each plate was\n counted after the 12-hour incubation. Finally, the BKA of each plasma\n sample was quantified as the percent difference in the number of colonies\n on plasma treated plates compared to the number of colonies on control\n plates. Statistical Methods: We compared masses of nestlings on day 14\n among supplement groups to determine if variation in supplemental feeding\n schedules affected fledging mass. We used R (v. 4.1.0) to create linear\n mixed-effects models from the lme4 package to account for non-independence\n of nestlings and mated pairs from the same nest. NestID, a concatenate\n variable created with nest box names and start dates, was included as a\n random effect to account for non-independence and month was included as a\n fixed effect to account for seasonal variation. Masses of adults were\n collected at the time of capture and, while we did not anticipate an\n effect of our experiment on adult mass, we analyzed adult body mass\n separately using the same methods as for nestlings. We conducted separate\n analyses on adults and nestlings for CORT, H:L ratios, and BKA. We again\n used linear mixed-effects models from the lme4 package to account for\n non-independence of nestlings and included NestID, as a random effect.\n Month was also included in these analyses as a fixed effect. For CORT, we\n evaluated 56 adults and 220 nestlings. For H:L ratios, we analyzed 48\n adults and 44 nestlings, and for BKA, we analyzed 49 adults and 69\n nestlings. For nestling measures of H:L ratio, we selected one nestling at\n random from each brood prior to data collection due to constraints on\n supplies and personnel. We acknowledge that nestlings might exhibit high\n variability in physiological traits within the same nest, but we opted to\n capture population-level variation, rather than within nest variation.\n CORT and H:L ratios were not normally distributed; therefore, we\n normalized these values by log10 transformation (Lobato et al., 2009). To\n evaluate the effect of supplemental feeding on nesting success, we\n compared hatching and fledging success among experimental groups with\n month included as a fixed effect. Finally, to assess whether adult\n physiology was predictive of nesting success, we also determined whether\n CORT, BKA, or H:L ratios were associated with measures of nesting success\n across treatment groups. We used logistic regressions with a quasibinomial\n distribution for these analyses because fledging and hatching success\n varied between 0 and 1, with intermediate values representing portions of\n broods that successfully hatched or fledged. To ensure independence of\n measurements in instances when we had data from two adults associated with\n a nest, we removed one individual using a random number generator in\n Python (v. 3.6). Thus, only one adult was associated with success at each\n nest. We also included month as a factor due to the potential for\n reproductive success to vary during the season."],"descriptionType":["Methods"]},{"description":["Rename file paths to those appropriate for your computer.

Despite the potential for feather\n metrics to advance our understanding of foraging, they are underused in\n avian ecology. One reason for this is the difficulty of interpreting\n whether individual variation is driven by ontogenetic, genetic, or\n environmental effects, which is exacerbated by the fact that most analyses\n have been done on cross-sectional data. We addressed this deficit using a\n longitudinal dataset of tail feathers collected from Great tits Parus\n major to test for ontogenetic and genetic effects on growth rate, mass and\n length, while controlling for body/feather size differences and other\n confounding factors. First, we found that the type of moult episode and\n experimentally-induced replacement differentially affected the length,\n mass and growth of feathers, providing evidence of an ontogenetic effect\n that should be considered when comparing these feather traits across\n individuals as a measure of condition. Second, we detected moderate to\n high repeatability and heritability values from parent-offspring\n regression for these three feather traits, which are suggestive of an\n underlying genetic component of variation. Third, we used a mean centring\n within-individual approach to test whether feather growth rate and feather\n mass (length-corrected) are indeed positively correlated with each other\n as overlapping indicators of body condition in birds, and found that this\n association, although positive, is weak and only significant between\n individuals. This suggests that both metrics are not so intimately linked\n as originally thought, and probably have different sensitivities to\n variation in foraging performance and ecological conditions.

However, to date, examples of trophic mismatch have centrally\n focused on those induced by shifts in climate. Here we report on the\n potential for humans to induce trophic mismatch by shifting the phenology\n of fire. Globally, anthropogenic fire ignitions are phenologically\n mismatched to that of historic lightning ignitions but the effects of this\n phenological mismatch on trophic interactions are poorly understood. Using\n fire records from 1980-2016 from the southeastern USA, a hotspot of\n anthropogenic fire, we demonstrate that there is a temporal mismatch\n between anthropogenic and lightning lit fires in this region. The peak of\n anthropogenic ignitions (i.e., 45% during March and April) occurred 3\n months earlier than the peak in lightning-ignited fires (i.e., 44%\n occurred during June and July), a pattern consistent with reports from\n several other regions and continents. We demonstrate with a field\n experiment conducted at a nutrient-poor site in the southeastern U.S.,\n that anthropogenic fire phenology shifts nutrient pulses in resprouting\n plants so that they mismatch herbivore reproductive demands. Consequently,\n plant nutrient quality in four commonly consumed forages was below the\n threshold to meet lactation requirements. Neonates subsequently were more\n likely to starve when born far from areas burned during the peak month of\n lightning fire phenology. Our data indicate that human activities may be\n an additional causative agent of trophic mismatch."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["Regional fire data We downloaded wildland fire occurrence data for all\n fires that occurred in 11 states in the southeastern United States for the\n time period of 1980–2015 from the federal fire occurrence database\n (https://wildfire.cr.usgs.gov/firehistory/data.html). The states chosen\n included Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi,\n North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. We\n extracted all fires known to be caused by lightning and all fires that\n were known to be prescribed, along with their respective ignition dates.\n We used the start date listed for each fire to assign it to month of\n ignition. We then plotted the average percentage with standard error\n across years by month of anthropogenic and lightning ignited fires. Field\n experiment study area We sampled forage quality and neonate survival at\n Fort Bragg Military Installation (Fort Bragg), North Carolina, USA\n (35.1°N, −79.2°W). The 73 469 ha area was located in the Sandhills\n physiographic region of the longleaf pine Pinus palustris ecosystem. This\n ecosystem and the species within evolved over millennia with relatively\n frequent (3-year average), low-intensity surface fires occurring due to\n lightning, and native American activities over the past 10 000–20 000\n years (Outcalt 2000). For the purposes of restoring ecosystem function and\n conserving endangered species, the United States Department of Defense has\n managed forested stands on a 3-yr fire regime (Lashley et al. 2014b). The\n parturition phenology of the local ungulate (i.e. white-tailed\n deer Odocoileus virginianus) peaks in early June (Chitwood et al. 2015a).\n Thus, because the peak nutritional demand occurs during lactation 3–6\n weeks after parturition in white-tailed deer (Hewitt 2011), the peak\n nutritional demand based on reproductive phenology of this herbivore in\n this area is during July.In this study area, soil productivity is\n particularly poor (Lashley et al. 2015b). Thus, deer may be sensitive to\n shifts in resource pulse phenology. As evidence of this nutritional\n burden, a relatively large portion of neonates starve on the site,\n regardless of fire timing, as compared to similar studies in more\n productive soil regions (Chitwood et al. 2014, 2015b). Likewise, diet\n selection is relatively narrow and concentrated on obtaining exceedingly\n limited quantities of phosphorus (Lashley et al. 2015b, 2016). Moreover,\n predation risk is relatively high (Chitwood et al. 2014, 2015b, 2017) and\n may limit female selection of the highest quality resources during\n lactation (Lashley et al. 2015c). Importantly, this population does not\n have access to anthropogenic subsidies as is common in other parts of\n their range, so changes in starvation should be related to available\n nutrition in the native plant community. Field experiment study design In\n a randomized block design, we selected four upland longleaf pine forest\n stands in each of 3 separate watersheds (blocks), averaging ~8 km apart,\n with similar soil types (Candor Sands complex) and similar basal area\n (45–60 m2 ha−1). We randomly assigned stands to each of four fire\n phenologies relative to our plant sampling period (see next section):\n fires ignited in June of the previous year (1 year-since-fire), and fires\n ignited in the same year in February (i.e. early anthropogenic phenology),\n April (i.e. late anthropogenic phenology) and June (lightning phenology).\n The February fire phenology was meant to represent the onset of the\n anthropogenic fire season (Brennan et al. 1998, Cox and Widener 2008). The\n April fire phenology was intended to represent the end of the\n anthropogenic fire season (Platt et al. 1988, Robbins and Myers\n 1992, Streng et al. 1993, Glitzenstein et al. 1995, Kirkman et al.\n 1998, Hiers et al. 2000, Knapp et al. 2009). The June fire phenology was\n meant to represent the peak in lightning fires for this region (Knapp et\n al. 2009). Each block contained a replicate from each treatment, and 1\n year-since-fire was intended to be the control for comparison to fires\n ignited in the same year because previous reports suggested that any\n nutritional benefits would be lost after a single growing season (Dills\n 1970, Wood 1988, Carlson et al. 1993, Van de Vijver et al. 1999, Long et\n al. 2008, Nichols et al. 2021). Plant sampling and analysis We selected 4\n native plant species that occurred in every replicate of each fire\n treatment. Because deer eat plants of several growth forms, we selected 2\n trees, 1 shrub and 1 forb to ensure the plants represented responses\n across functional groups. The trees collected were common\n persimmon Diospyros virginiana and sassafras Sassafras albidum, the shrub\n was dwarf huckleberry Gaylussacia umosa and the forb was fragrant\n goldenrod Solidago odora. We selected these species because they are\n common in the study area and commonly consumed by white-tailed deer\n (Lashley et al. 2015b, 2016).In each month of the growing season (i.e.\n May–September), we remotely established a plot center in each replicate of\n each treatment using a geographic information system. We navigated to the\n a priori selected plot center and collected the foliage of the nearest 10\n plants of each species that were in the understory strata (i.e. &lt;\n 1.5 m tall), separately bagging young leaves and the mature plant parts\n not typically eaten by this herbivore (Lashley et al. 2014a). We used\n previous data collected on site to determine that 10 plant samples was\n robust to the expected variation in intraspecific plant nutritional value\n (Lashley et al. 2015b). We separated physiologically mature and immature\n plant parts because plant maturity affects quality, and we were interested\n in how fire affects relative maturity of plant tissue, quality of young\n leaves, as well as quality of the whole plant. We assumed that secondary\n plant compounds were not significantly affecting nutritive quality based\n on results presented in Jones et al. (2010) that demonstrated tannin\n defensive compounds in forages consumed by herbivores in this region were\n generally low. If a plant was discolored, malformed or damaged (by\n herbivory or otherwise), we did not collect the plant tissues and instead\n sampled the next nearest plant. To avoid biases associated with forage\n handling, we followed the protocol presented by Lashley et al. (2014a) by\n transporting samples within 3 hours to a convection oven and drying\n forages to constant mass at 47°C. After drying samples, we measured weight\n to the nearest 0.01 g of the young and mature plant parts and shipped\n samples to the Clemson University Agricultural Service Laboratory, which\n was certified by the United States National Forage Testing Association.The\n lab performed a standard full nutrient array with chemical determination\n methods to yield the percent of each sample of young and mature plant\n parts that was crude protein (i.e. nitrogen × 6.25; CP), acid detergent\n fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF). For the same samples, we\n obtained measurements for macro-nutrients phosphorus (P), potassium (K)\n and calcium (Ca), and micro-nutrients magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), copper\n (Cu), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), sulfur (S) and sodium (Na). After\n obtaining the nutritional parameters for physiologically young and mature\n plant parts, we calculated the whole plant nutritional value by weighting\n each sample by the relative proportion of physiologically young and mature\n plant parts and their associated nutritional values.For the purposes of\n understanding the effects of fire phenology mismatch on available\n nutrition for white-tailed deer, we calculated the phosphorus requirements\n of a lactating white-tailed deer conservatively based on the minimum\n concentration needed to obtain adequate phosphorus assuming forage\n abundance was not limiting maximum possible physiological intake. We used\n this nutrient specifically because it was formerly deemed the limiting\n nutrient on this study site (Lashley et al. 2015b). However, we recorded\n the array of nutrients because it was part of a standard analysis at the\n lab. We assumed a maximum daily intake for a 45 kg animal (i.e. average\n adult female on site (Lashley et al. 2015b)) was 4.8% of the body weight\n or 2.16 kg day−1 (dry matter), which is the reported physiologically\n limited possible dry matter intake for female white-tailed deer during\n peak lactation (National Research Council 2007). Our intention with this\n calculation was simply to compare the forage quality in terms of\n phosphorus availability in the plants following each respective fire\n phenology to determine if those plants would meet the phosphorus\n requirement for an average size female with one fawn in the study area. We\n estimated the phosphorus concentration of the plants would need to be a\n minimum of 0.025% for a lactating female which is consistent with previous\n estimates (McEwen et al. 1957, Barnes et al. 1990). In JMP Pro 11.0 (SAS\n Corporation, Cary North Carolina, USA), we fit general linear mixed models\n with restricted maximum likelihood to evaluate the effects of fire\n treatments on the proportion of biomass contributed by young leaves, the\n nutritional quality of young leaves and the nutritional quality of the\n whole plant. We included random effects of drainage (i.e. block) and plant\n species to control for influences on nutritional quality not related to\n fire. Influence of fire phenology on deer reproductive success To\n determine the influence of fire phenology on deer reproductive success, we\n radiotagged pregnant female white-tailed deer in winter to identify birth\n site locations relative to burned areas on the landscape and measure the\n subsequent survival of the neonates. Each female was fitted with a vaginal\n implant transmitter (VIT) to aid in the discovery of birth sites and\n hours-old neonates. We fitted each neonate with an expandable, breakaway\n VHF collar that had a 4-hr motion-sensitive mortality switch. We monitored\n neonates intensively (i.e. every 4–8 hrs) for the first month of life via\n VHF and continued monitoring survival at reduced time intervals until\n fawns reached 16 weeks (Chitwood et al. 2015a). Thus, survival of neonates\n was our proxy for reproductive success in this study. When we detected a\n mortality signal from the collar, we tracked to the collar to determine\n cause of mortality using field evidence and, when predation was evident or\n suspected, DNA swabs for residual predator saliva on the carcass and/or\n radiotag (Chitwood et al. 2015a). We necropsied all carcasses to finalize\n cause of mortality; individuals with no signs of predation that had lost\n body mass since capture and had empty digestive tracts were classified as\n starvation (Chitwood et al. 2015a). We used the birth site location of\n each neonate to calculate a straight line distance to the nearest area\n burned during the lightning season (i.e. June in the study area). This\n allowed us to determine if proximity to areas burned in the lightning\n season affected the likelihood of neonate starvation. Using a binary\n logistic regression in JMP Pro 11.0, we used the straight line distance\n from each birth site to the nearest area burned during the lightning\n phenology to predict the probability of starvation. Our rationale for\n using straight line distance to areas burned in lightning season was that\n in this resource limited environment, which does not contain anthropogenic\n subsidies or agriculture, the predicted pulse in available nutrients\n following fire would serve as the highest quality foraging opportunity for\n lactating females in this system and thus, serve as a primary means to\n meet the demands of lactation (Chitwood et al. 2015a, 2017, Lashley et al.\n 2015b, Nichols et al. 2021). All protocols presented herein were approved\n by the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission and the NCSU IACUC\n (no. 10-143-O)."],"descriptionType":["Methods"]}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":["https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.sxksn034z"],"contentUrl":{},"metadataVersion":[5],"schemaVersion":["http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4"],"source":["mds"],"isActive":[true],"state":["findable"],"reason":{},"viewCount":[107],"downloadCount":[4],"referenceCount":[0],"citationCount":[1],"partCount":[0],"partOfCount":[0],"versionCount":[0],"versionOfCount":[0],"created":["2022-02-10T19:23:50Z"],"registered":["2022-02-10T19:23:51Z"],"published":{},"updated":["2024-04-11T03:08:08Z"]},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":["dryad.dryad"],"type":["clients"]}}}},{"id":["10.5061/dryad.n2z34tmzb"],"type":["dois"],"attributes":{"doi":["10.5061/dryad.n2z34tmzb"],"identifiers":[],"creators":[{"name":["Liu,

are constantly under selection to respond effectively to\n diverse, sometimes rapid, changes in their environment, but not all\n individuals are equally plastic in their behaviour. Although cognitive\n processes and personality are expected to influence individual behavioural\n plasticity, the effects reported are highly inconsistent, which we\n hypothesise is because ecological context is usually not considered. We\n explored how one type of behavioural plasticity, foraging flexibility, was\n associated with inhibitory control (assayed using a detour-reaching task)\n and exploration behaviour in a novel environment (a trait closely linked\n to the fast-slow personality axis). We investigated how these effects\n varied across two experimentally manipulated ecological contexts, food\n value and predation risk. In the first phase of the experiment, we trained\n great tits Parus major to retrieve high value (preferred) food that was\n hidden in sand so that this became the familiar food source. In the second\n phase, we offered them the same familiar hidden food at the same time as a\n new alternative option that was visible on the surface, which was either\n high or low value, and under either high or low perceived predation risk.\n Foraging flexibility was defined as the proportion of choices made during\n four minute trials that were for the new alternative food source. Our\n assays captured consistent differences among individuals in foraging\n flexibility. Inhibitory control was associated with foraging flexibility -\n birds with high inhibitory control were more flexible when the alternative\n food was high value, suggesting they inhibited the urge to select the\n familiar food and instead selected the new food option. Exploration\n behaviour also predicted flexibility – fast explorers were more flexible,\n supporting the information gathering hypothesis. This tendency was\n especially strong under high predation risk, suggesting risk aversion also\n influenced the observed flexibility because fast explorers are risk prone\n and the new unfamiliar food was perceived to be the risky option. Thus,\n both behaviours predicted flexibility, and these links were at least\n partly dependent on ecological conditions.

While long recognized that\n mucilage allows seeds to anchor to substrates (antitelechory), resisting\n abiotic and biotic dislodgement, we still lack a mechanistic understanding\n of this process. Methods: We propose a mechanistic model of how mucilage\n affects substrate anchorage and fluid resistance, ultimately contributing\n to dislodgement resistance. To test this model, we subjected mucilaginous\n seeds of 52 species, varying in eight measured seed traits, to seven days\n of continuous water flow at a range of dislodgement potentials. Key\n Results: Supporting our model, mucilage mass increased force necessary to\n dislodge both dry and wet seeds; our measurement of the dislodgement force\n of dry mucilage explained time to dislodgement well. The effect size was\n remarkably large; increasing the standardized mucilage mass by one\n standard deviation resulted in a 280-fold increase in the time to\n dislodgement. Fluid resistance was largely dependent on speed of water\n flow and the seed’s modified drag coefficient, but not seed traits.\n Neither mucilage expansion speed nor mucilage decay rate explained\n dislodgement potential well.  Conclusions: Our results suggest that the\n degree of anchorage to substrate, measured with a simple dislodgement\n force assay, is highly predictive of mucilaginous seed retention in highly\n erosive environments. In contrast, we found that other seed and mucilage\n traits are of lesser importance to anchorage."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["See

Anthropogenic development in\n natural ecosystems can result in a variety of behavioral responses that\n can involve changes in either movement (speed or direction of travel) or\n selection (resources used) behaviors which in turn may cause differential\n population level consequences including loss of landscape level\n connectivity. Understanding how a species alters these different behaviors\n in response to human activity is essential for effective conservation. In\n this study, we investigated the effects of anthropogenic development such\n as roads, power lines and oil wells on the greater prairie-chicken\n (Typanuchus cupido) in the post-nesting and nonbreeding season. Our first\n objective was to assess if greater prairie-chickens alter their movement\n behaviors or their selection patterns when encountering oil wells, power\n lines, or roads using integrated step selection analysis (iSSA). Our\n second objective was to determine if prairie-chickens avoided crossing\n linear features such as roads or power lines by comparing the number of\n crossing events in greater prairie-chicken movement tracks to the number\n of movements that crossed these features in simulated movement tracks.\n Based on the iSSA analysis, we found that greater prairie-chickens avoided\n oil wells, power lines, and roads in both seasons, but found little\n evidence for changes in speed or direction of movement at the\n population-level. However, at the individual level we observed individuals\n using a number of strategies near development including avoidance and\n increased rates of movements. Furthermore, prairie-chickens traveled\n across roads and power lines at much lower rates than expected. Consistent\n avoidance of development resulted in indirect habitat loss for greater\n prairie-chickens. These behaviors also resulted in a potential loss of\n landscape connectivity for this species. By considering both movement and\n selection we were able to develop an ecological understanding of how\n increasing human activity may influence the space-use of this species of\n conservation concern. This research provides insight into the\n decision-making process by animals when they encounter anthropogenic\n development by considering multiple behavioral responses. --"],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["We captured prairie-chickens in March and April of each year from 2014 –\n 2019 using walk-in funnel traps at lek sites (communal courtship arenas).\n We aged and sexed all captured individuals based on plumage and the\n presence of secondary sex characteristics (enlarged air sacs and eye combs\n in males; Henderson et al. 1967), and we marked males and females with a\n uniquely numbered aluminum leg band to aid in identification. We attached\n rump-mounted, 22-gram ARGOS GPS transmitters (PTT-100, Microwave\n Telemetry, Columbia, Maryland, USA) to all captured female\n prairie-chickens. The GPS transmitters were programmed to record one GPS\n location every hour from 700 to 1900 from 1 March to 31 August and every\n two hours during the remainder of the year. All females were monitored\n remotely via data downloads from the ARGOS server as data became\n available. The GPS transmitters were estimated to have an average error of\n less than 20 meters (personal communication Microwave Telemetry). We\n focused on two seasons for our analysis, the post-nesting and the\n nonbreeding season. We defined the post-nesting season as the period after\n a female concluded nesting activity for the year (typically late May to\n early June) until 14 September when the last broods are likely to have\n broken up prior to the fall/winter season. The start of the post-nesting\n period was determined separately for each individual based on when\n individual females were observed leaving the nest site (Londe et al.\n 2019). This period corresponds to the time when females are either raising\n newly hatched chicks or are recovering from previous reproductive efforts.\n Due to a lack of data about brood presence and survival in the early parts\n of our study, we combined data for all females during this period\n regardless of reproductive status. Previous studies suggest habitat\n selection patterns are likely similar between brooding and nonbrooding\n female prairie-chickens (Londe et al. 2019, Londe et al. 2021). The\n nonbreeding season was defined as the period from 15 September to 15 March\n of the subsequent year. This period corresponds to the fall and winter\n period when females are not engaged in any reproductive activity. We did\n not include telemetry locations from the period when females are attending\n leks (mid-March to late April) and nesting (early April to nest hatch or\n failure) as movements during these periods are limited and tend to be\n concentrated on leks or nest locations. For prairie-chickens that were\n monitored in multiple years in the study, we treated each year (hereafter,\n prairie-chicken year) as a separate individual to account for changing\n habitat conditions between years of the study (Hovick et al. 2015).\n Integrated step selection analysis  Integrated step selection analysis\n (iSSA) allows for the simultaneous modelling of selection and movement\n processes by comparing environmental and habitat variables observed during\n a step (straight line connecting two GPS locations) and variables that\n describe an animal’s movement pattern, such as step length and turning\n angles (change in direction of travel between two steps), to those same\n variables recorded on random steps (Fortin et al. 2005, Thurfjell et al.\n 2014). For our analysis, we used observed prairie-chicken steps where the\n beginning and ending locations were at GPS telemetry locations that were\n recorded 2 hours apart, and were part of a series of steps that included ≥\n 3 telemetry locations (this is the minimum number of consecutive\n relocations required to calculate valid turning angles; Avgar et al.\n 2016). For each observed step, we generated 10 random steps that shared a\n starting location with the observed step, but where step length and\n turning angles of the random step was randomly selected from a gamma and\n von Mises distribution, respectively (Avgar et al. 2016, Signer et al.\n 2019). We assigned habitat attributes to each step by extracting\n environmental variables from GIS rasters at the beginning and ending\n location for each step. Each set of observed and ten random steps was\n defined as a choice set and were compared using conditional logistic\n regression models in program R using the survival package (Therneau and\n Lumley 2015). Prior to analysis, we removed six individuals from the\n post-nesting season analysis and nine individuals from the nonbreeding\n season analysis that had established home ranges in areas where there was\n no oil and gas development, and the only roads were private ranch roads\n that received little traffic."],"descriptionType":["Methods"]},{"description":["All data needed to perform the integrated step selection analysis in the\n two files titled as \"summer_ssf.csv\" (for the post-nesting\n analysis) and \"winter_ssf.csv\" (for the nonbreeding analysis).\n Columns within each file is the same.  ID contains a unique id number for\n each bird/year combination.

Under the multispecies coalescent model, in\n which the dominant quartet topology displayed across gene trees matches\n the topology of that quartet on the species tree, we propose a Bayesian\n framework to select samples for which there is support for inclusion in a\n species tree analysis. Given a collection of gene trees, a posterior\n probability is assigned to each quartet topology, describing the\n likelihood that the species tree displays this topology. From this,\n individual samples are assigned reliability scores computed as the average\n of a rescaling of the posterior probabilities. These weights are used in a\n Bayesian framework in an algorithm called PickM}, which determines which\n individuals should be included in a species tree analysis. To illustrate\n the efficacy of this tool, PickMe is applied to gene trees generated from\n target capture data from milkweeds. PickMe indicates that more samples\n could have reliably been included in a previous milkweed phylogenomic\n analysis than the authors analyzed, without access to a formal\n decision-making procedure.

resource selection (an organism’s disproportionate use of\n available resources) is essential to infer habitat requirements of a\n species, develop management recommendations, predict species responses to\n changing conditions, and improve our understanding of the processes that\n underlie ecological patterns. Because study sites, even within the same\n region, can differ in both the amount and the arrangement of cover types,\n our objective was to determine whether proximal sites can yield markedly\n different resource selection results for a generalist bird, northern\n bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). We used five years of telemetry locations\n and newly developed land cover data at two, geographically distinct but\n relatively close sites in the south central semi-arid prairies of North\n America. We fit a series of generalized linear mixed models and used an\n information-theoretic model comparison approach to identify and compare\n resource selection patterns at each site. We determined that the\n importance of different cover types to northern bobwhite is site-dependent\n on relatively similar and nearby sites. Specifically, whether bobwhite\n selected for shrub cover and whether they strongly avoided trees, depended\n on the study site in focus. Additionally, the spatial scale of selection\n was nearly an order of magnitude different between the cover types. Our\n study demonstrates that—even for one of the most intensively studied\n species in the world—we may oversimplify resource selection by using a\n single study site approach. Managing the tradeoffs between practical,\n generalized conclusions and precise but complex conclusions is one of the\n central challenges in applied ecology. However, we caution against setting\n recommendations for broad extents based on information gathered at small\n extents, even for a generalist species at adjacent sites.

The producer-scrounger game is a key element of foraging ecology in\n many systems. Producing and scrounging typically covary negatively, but\n partitioning this covariance into contributions of individual plasticity\n and consistent between individual differences is key to understanding\n population level consequences of foraging strategies. Furthermore, little\n is known about the role cognition plays in the producer-scrounger game. 2.\n We investigated the role of cognition in these alternative foraging\n tactics in wild mixed-species flocks of great tits and blue tits, using a\n production learning task in which we measured individuals’ speed of\n learning to visit the single feeder in an array that would provide them\n with a food reward. We also quantified the proportion of individuals’\n feeds that were scrounges (‘proportion scrounged’); scrounging was\n possible if individuals visited immediately after a previous rewarded\n visitor. Three learning experiments–initial and two reversal\n learning–enabled us to estimate the repeatability and covariance of each\n foraging behaviour. 3. First, we examined whether individuals learned to\n improve their scrounging success (i.e. whether they actually obtained food\n by scrounging when there was an opportunity to do so). Second, we\n quantified the repeatability of proportion scrounged, and asked whether\n proportion scrounged affected production learning speed among individuals.\n Third, we used multivariate analyses to partition within- and\n among-individual components of covariance between proportion scrounged and\n production learning speed. 4. Individuals improved their scrounging\n success over time. Birds with a greater proportion scrounged took longer\n to learn their own rewarding feeder. Although multivariate analyses showed\n that covariance between proportion scrounged and learning speed was driven\n primarily by within-individual variation, that is, by behavioural\n plasticity, among-individual differences also played a role for blue tits.\n 5. This is the first demonstration of a cognitive trait influencing\n producing and scrounging in the same wild system, highlighting the\n importance of cognition in the use of alternative resource acquisition\n tactics. The results of our covariance analyses suggest the potential for\n genetic differences in allocation to alternative foraging tactics, which\n are likely species and system dependent.

(the dogbane and milkweed family) is one of the ten largest\n flowering plant families, with approximately 5,350 species and diverse\n morphology and ecology, ranging from large trees and lianas that are\n emblematic of tropical rainforests, to herbs in temperate grasslands, to\n succulents in dry, open landscapes, and to vines in a wide variety of\n habitats. Despite a specialized and conservative basic floral\n architecture, Apocynaceae are hyperdiverse in flower size, corolla shape,\n and especially derived floral morphological features. These are mainly\n associated with the development of corolline and/or staminal coronas and a\n spectrum of integration of floral structures culminating with the\n formation of a gynostegium and pollinaria—specialized pollen dispersal\n units. To date, no detailed analysis has been conducted to estimate the\n origin and diversification of this lineage in space and time. Here, we use\n the most comprehensive time-calibrated phylogeny of Apocynaceae, which\n includes approximately 20% of the species covering all major lineages, and\n information on species number and distributions obtained from the most\n up-to-date monograph of the family to investigate the biogeographical\n history of the lineage and its diversification dynamics. South America,\n Africa, and Southeast Asia (potentially including Oceania), were recovered\n as the most likely ancestral area of extant Apocynaceae diversity; this\n tropical climatic belt in the equatorial region retained the oldest extant\n lineages and these three tropical regions likely represent museums of the\n family. Africa was confirmed as the cradle of pollinia-bearing lineages\n and the main source of Apocynaceae intercontinental dispersals. We\n detected 12 shifts toward accelerated species diversification, of which 11\n were in the APSA clade (apocynoids, Periplocoideae, Secamonoideae, and\n Asclepiadoideae), eight of these in the pollinia-bearing lineages and six\n within Asclepiadoideae. Wind-dispersed comose seeds, climbing growth form,\n and pollinia appeared sequentially within the APSA clade and probably work\n synergistically in the occupation of drier and cooler habitats. Overall,\n we hypothesize that temporal patterns in diversification of Apocynaceae\n was mainly shaped by a sequence of morphological innovations that\n conferred higher capacity to disperse and establish in seasonal, unstable,\n and open habitats, which have expanded since the Eocene-Oligocene climate\n transition."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["Phylogenetic data from Fishbein et al.

how the biological invasion is driven by environmental\n factors will improve model prediction and advance early detection,\n especially in the context of accelerating anthropogenic ecological\n changes. Although a large body of studies has examined how favorable\n environments promote biological invasions, a more comprehensive and\n mechanistic understanding of invasive species response to\n unfavorable/stressful conditions is still developing. Grass invasion has\n been problematic across the globe; in particular, C4 grass invaders, with\n high drought tolerance, adaptations to high temperatures, and high water\n use efficiency, could become more severe. Here, we conducted a rigorous\n microcosm experiment, with one of the most damaging invasive C4 grass -\n cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica), to explore how cogongrass responds to\n soil water and nutrient stress. We further integrated the results of the\n microcosm study with a species distribution model to (1) corroborate\n greenhouse results with field observations and (2) validate the robustness\n of our findings at sub-continental scales. Both the microcosm experiments\n and species distribution model agreed that soil water stress had a\n stronger impact on cogongrass than the nutrient one. New vegetative growth\n of cogongrass continued to be inhibited by the prior water stress. The\n significant water effect on cogongrass total biomass was supported by the\n finding that both allometric and biochemical traits of cogongrass did not\n show significant responses to the changes in water treatment. Different to\n the conventional wisdom that nutrient enrichment plays a bigger role in\n facilitating biological invasions, this study highlighted the possibility\n that water conditions may have a more substantial effect on some\n aggressive invaders. Therefore, an important implication of this study on\n biological conservation is that field managers might take advantage of the\n negative effect of global drought on some invasive species to increase the\n efficiency of their controlling efforts because invasive species may\n become more vulnerable under drought effect."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["The data were collected in a greenhouse experiment."],"descriptionType":["Methods"]}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[{"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"funderName":["National Science Foundation"],"awardNumber":["1817124"],"funderIdentifier":["https://ror.org/021nxhr62"],"funderIdentifierType":["ROR"]},{"funderName":["UC Davis Chancellor’s postdoc fellowship*"]}],"url":["https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.25338/B8SH0S"],"contentUrl":{},"metadataVersion":[8],"schemaVersion":["http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4"],"source":["mds"],"isActive":[true],"state":["findable"],"reason":{},"viewCount":[144],"downloadCount":[11],"referenceCount":[0],"citationCount":[0],"partCount":[0],"partOfCount":[0],"versionCount":[0],"versionOfCount":[0],"created":["2021-05-14T18:23:08Z"],"registered":["2021-05-14T18:23:09Z"],"published":{},"updated":["2024-04-10T23:40:45Z"]},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":["dryad.dryad"],"type":["clients"]}}}},{"id":["10.5061/dryad.nzs7h44rd"],"type":["dois"],"attributes":{"doi":["10.5061/dryad.nzs7h44rd"],"identifiers":[],"creators":[{"name":["Ansley, Jim"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Jim"],"familyName":["Ansley"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[{"schemeUri":["https://orcid.org"],"nameIdentifier":["https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4448-5623"],"nameIdentifierScheme":["ORCID"]}]}],"titles":[{"title":["Herbaceous production and soil nitrogen after mesquite mortality"]}],"publisher":["Dryad"],"container":{},"publicationYear":[2021],"subjects":[],"contributors":[],"dates":[{"date":["2021-05-07T00:00:00Z"],"dateType":["Issued"]},{"date":["2021-05-07T00:00:00Z"],"dateType":["Available"]}],"language":["en"],"types":{"ris":["DATA"],"bibtex":["misc"],"citeproc":["dataset"],"schemaOrg":["Dataset"],"resourceType":["dataset"],"resourceTypeGeneral":["Dataset"]},"relatedIdentifiers":[{"relationType":["IsSourceOf"],"relatedIdentifier":["10.5281/zenodo.7555608"],"relatedIdentifierType":["DOI"]}],"relatedItems":[],"sizes":[["393338 bytes"]],"formats":[],"version":["4"],"rightsList":[{"rights":["Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal"],"rightsUri":["https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode"],"schemeUri":["https://spdx.org/licenses/"],"rightsIdentifier":["cc0-1.0"],"rightsIdentifierScheme":["SPDX"]}],"descriptions":[{"description":["In the mixed C3/C4 grassland of the southern Great Plains, USA, the\n invasive woody legume, honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), affects grass\n production and composition differently beneath the canopy (subcanopy) than\n in spaces between trees (intercanopy) due in part to the dominant presence\n of C3 Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha) beneath the mesquite canopy\n and soil enrichment from N-fixation by mesquite.

Human-caused noise pollution dominates the soundscape of modern\n ecosystems, from urban centers to national parks. Though wildlife can\n generally alter their communication to accommodate many types of natural\n noise (e.g. wind, wave action, heterospecific communication), noise\n pollution from anthropogenic sources pushes the limits of wildlife\n communication flexibility by causing loud, low-pitched, and\n near-continuous interference. Because responses to noise pollution are\n variable and taxa-specific, multi-species risk assessments and mitigation\n are not currently possible. 2. We conducted a meta-analysis to synthesize\n noise pollution effects on terrestrial wildlife communication.\n Specifically, we assessed: 1) the impacts of noise pollution on modulation\n of call rate, duration, amplitude, and frequency (including peak, minimum,\n and maximum frequency); and 2) the literature on anthropogenic noise\n pollution by region, taxa, study design, and disturbance type. 3.\n Terrestrial wildlife (results driven by avian studies) generally respond\n to noise pollution by calling with higher minimum frequencies, while they\n generally do not alter the amplitude, maximum frequency, peak frequency,\n duration, and rate of calling. 4. The literature on noise pollution\n research is biased towards birds, population-level studies, urban noise\n sources, and study systems in North America. 5. Policy applications Our\n study reveals the ways in which wildlife can alter their signals to\n contend with anthropogenic noise, and discusses the potential fitness and\n management consequences of these signal alterations.

We restricted the search to\n terrestrial systems because general approaches to noise pollution risk\n assessment and recommendations for noise mitigation already exist for some\n coastal and marine systems (Southall et al. 2007). Perhaps more\n importantly, a vast body of research conducted to date on marine wildlife\n has yielded valuable knowledge such as species-specific spectral\n sensitivity, critical impact thresholds, and mitigation effectiveness\n which can be drawn upon to advance general theory and research and to\n develop further regulatory guidelines (Erbe et al. 2016). Finally, the\n physics of sound transmission differ between water and air, affecting both\n how sound is perceived by organisms and potential mitigation strategies\n (Würsig et al. 2000, Shannon et al. 2015). We used Web of Science (search\n conducted 4/5/2018) to search for studies investigating the impact of\n noise pollution on wildlife modulation of call frequency, rate, duration,\n and amplitude (see Table 2 for specific search terms). We assessed these\n multiple communication response variables even though they may be related\n because each response may have different ecological and/or evolutionary\n implications. An initial search produced 815 studies. After implementing\n all inclusion criteria (see below), our search resulted in 181 data points\n from 32 studies representing six continents (Table 3). We used the\n “Analyze Results” feature in Web of Science to filter out irrelevant\n disciplines (e.g., Audiology, Speech Pathology, nexcluded = 347). After\n compiling remaining results into a database, we removed duplicate studies\n (nexcluded = 5) and studies determined to be topically irrelevant based on\n reading of all titles (nexcluded = 117). We excluded studies broadcasting\n white noise as a treatment, as we were interested in responses to spectral\n characteristics that more closely match environmental noise pollution\n (i.e., loud, low-frequency sounds, nexcluded = 3). However, we retained\n one study that explicitly manipulated the characteristics of white noise\n to approximate low-frequency traffic sounds. We excluded studies conducted\n in a laboratory setting, as we were only interested in responses of\n free-living wildlife to noises experienced in their natural habitat\n (nexcluded = 5). After detailed screening of article texts, we removed\n studies that did not assess effects of noise pollution on the above focal\n response variables and studies with analysis methods or reporting that\n precluded us from extracting a relevant effect size (nexcluded = 59).\n             For remaining studies, we extracted the location, focal taxa,\n response variable, sound source, and study design. We also extracted\n means, sample sizes, and standard deviations of response variables for\n studies assessing categorical predictor variables (e.g., call\n characteristics at quiet and noisy sites), or values of Pearson’s r for\n studies assessing continuous predictor variables (e.g., response\n characteristics over a gradient of decibel levels). In studies with\n multiple treatments, we used the two extreme ends of the environmental\n sound spectrum for analysis. For example, if a study tested call rates in\n “quiet”, “moderate”, and “loud” environments, we compared responses\n between “quiet” and “loud” sites. Sound sources included airplane (n = 2),\n construction (n = 6), energy development (n = 17), roadway (n = 52), urban\n (n = 101), and white noise (n = 3). We also distinguished study designs as\n event-based (n = 41) versus continuous (n = 140). Event-based study\n designs evaluated instantaneous signal flexibility in the presence of\n anthropogenic sound (e.g., a grasshopper calling more loudly during an\n airplane overflight compared to normal conditions, Fig. 2). Continuous\n study designs, on the other hand, evaluated differences in acoustic\n properties between populations in loud and quiet environments (e.g.,\n communication characteristics of red-winged blackbirds, (Agelaius\n phoenicus), in rural versus urban environments; Fig. 2). Following our\n literature search, we incorporated a specific search for bat studies, as\n they were underrepresented in our initial search and we felt that they are\n good models for the study of anthropogenic sound impacts due to their\n reliance on acoustic information for both communication and foraging.  \n Analysis To assess potential biases in the noise pollution literature, we\n assessed observed versus expected proportions of studies using Pearson’s\n χ2 tests. We conducted these tests to analyze numbers of studies for each\n response variable, sound source, focal taxa, continent, and study design;\n in each case we tested a null hypothesis that an equal proportion of\n studies have been conducted for each category (e.g., 50% of studies each\n for event-based and continuous study designs). To control the Type I error\n rate, we employed a Holm’s Sequential Bonferroni correction. We conducted\n a meta-analysis to assess wildlife responses to noise pollution using the\n metafor package (Viechtbauer, 2010) in the R statistical environment\n (version 3.4.1, R Core Team 2017). We ran mixed-effects meta regression\n models with study design (event-based versus continuous), and taxa as\n fixed effects and study ID as a random effect. When possible, we\n calculated Hedge’s g for each study that used a categorical noise\n treatment. When studies evaluated responses to noise along a continuous\n gradient, we calculated Hedge’s g using Pearson’s r. To evaluate overall\n effect of each response variable (Minimum Frequency, Maximum Frequency,\n Peak Frequency, Duration, Rate, and Amplitude), as well as the effect of\n study type and taxa, we evaluated overlap of 95% confidence intervals with\n zero. After conducting analyses, we constructed Q-Q plots to visually\n assess model fit."],"descriptionType":["Methods"]}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[{"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"funderName":["United States Department of Agriculture"],"awardNumber":["ND02394"],"funderIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01na82s61"],"funderIdentifierType":["ROR"]}],"url":["https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.k6djh9w61"],"contentUrl":{},"metadataVersion":[6],"schemaVersion":["http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4"],"source":["mds"],"isActive":[true],"state":["findable"],"reason":{},"viewCount":[301],"downloadCount":[42],"referenceCount":[0],"citationCount":[1],"partCount":[0],"partOfCount":[0],"versionCount":[0],"versionOfCount":[0],"created":["2021-03-26T18:46:48Z"],"registered":["2021-03-26T18:46:49Z"],"published":{},"updated":["2024-04-10T23:01:14Z"]},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":["dryad.dryad"],"type":["clients"]}}}},{"id":["10.5061/dryad.fn2z34tss"],"type":["dois"],"attributes":{"doi":["10.5061/dryad.fn2z34tss"],"identifiers":[],"creators":[{"name":["Fullerton, Matthew"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Matthew"],"familyName":["Fullerton"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[{"schemeUri":["https://orcid.org"],"nameIdentifier":["https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9650-0901"],"nameIdentifierScheme":["ORCID"]}]},{"name":["Walters, Jeffrey"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Jeffrey"],"familyName":["Walters"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Virginia Tech"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/02smfhw86"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Will, Rodney"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Rodney"],"familyName":["Will"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Loss, Scott"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Scott"],"familyName":["Loss"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]}],"titles":[{"title":["Data from: Inter-annual climate variation influences nest initiation date and nest productivity of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker at the northwestern edge of its range"]}],"publisher":["Dryad"],"container":{},"publicationYear":[2021],"subjects":[],"contributors":[],"dates":[{"date":["2021-10-04T00:00:00Z"],"dateType":["Issued"]},{"date":["2021-10-04T00:00:00Z"],"dateType":["Available"]}],"language":["en"],"types":{"ris":["DATA"],"bibtex":["misc"],"citeproc":["dataset"],"schemaOrg":["Dataset"],"resourceType":["dataset"],"resourceTypeGeneral":["Dataset"]},"relatedIdentifiers":[{"relationType":["IsDerivedFrom"],"relatedIdentifier":["10.5281/zenodo.4537728"],"relatedIdentifierType":["DOI"]}],"relatedItems":[],"sizes":[["442803 bytes"]],"formats":[],"version":["5"],"rightsList":[{"rights":["Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal"],"rightsUri":["https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode"],"schemeUri":["https://spdx.org/licenses/"],"rightsIdentifier":["cc0-1.0"],"rightsIdentifierScheme":["SPDX"]}],"descriptions":[{"description":["Climate change, including directional shifts in weather averages and\n extremes and increased inter-annual weather variation, is influencing\n demograhy and distributions for many bird species.

Fullerton) using the\n open-source statistical program R and R Studio\n (https://www.R-project.org/). We combined data for nesting variables\n across all nests for each year and treated years as replicates (n=25 years\n for Oklahoma; n=23 years for Arkansas). Nesting variables assessed at this\n population level included, for first nests (i.e., excluding renests\n following nest failure), median nest initiation date (median date first\n egg was laid across all nests for a given year; treated as Julian date for\n analyses), average clutch size, and average estimated number of nestlings\n fledged. We used the median for nest initiation date. We defined 3 time\n windows for which all weather variables—including average daily maximum\n and daily minimum temperatures, as well as total precipitation—were\n separately calculated. We defined 30 and 60 day windows preceding the\n median first initiation date across all years for each population.\n Further, we defined a 40 day window with a start date based on the same\n median first nest initiation date as above. This 40 day period was\n selected to capture the average egg-laying period, incubation period, and\n period from hatching to fledging.For population-level analyses, we used\n generalized linear models with weather variables as fixed effects and a\n Gamma distribution with a log link. For nest initiation and clutch size\n analyses, we tested weather variables for the two windows (30 and 60 days)\n prior to nest initiation. For the fledgling analysis, we tested weather\n variables for the 40 day window from nest initiation to fledging. We\n conducted pairwise correlation tests among all predictor variables for\n each population and analysis. Before creating a global model, each\n predictor variable from a correlated pair was tested for correlation\n against the response variable of interest. Further, we tested independent\n effects of predictor variables. We used a backwards stepwise model\n selection approach, beginning with the global model containing all\n uncorrelated predictor variables and removing one variable at a time. We\n also conducted analyses at the individual nest level (i.e., individual\n nesting attempts 222 treated as replicates; n=232 nests for Oklahoma;\n n=612 nests for Arkansas) to assess effects of discrete weather events on\n nesting success and partial brood loss. For these analyses, we used\n generalized linear mixed models in the lme4 package, with year and cluster\n as random effects, and binomial and Poisson distributions for nest success\n and brood loss analyses, respectively. We treated cluster as a random\n effect. For nest success analyses, all active nests used in analyses were\n found within three days of the first egg being laid. We used initiation\n dates for individual nests to define unique, nest-specific time windows.\n We also defined 2 windows prior to nest initiation for each nest (7 and 14\n days). Three windows were also defined for after nest initiation,\n including the 11 day incubation period, the 7 day nestling period before\n nestlings were banded and brood reduction events were identified, and the\n 19 day nestling period between banding age and fledging at day 26. For all\n nest-level analyses, we used the above-described GLMM model structure, and\n for fixed effects, we included nest initiation date and weather variables\n (absolute maximum and minimum temperature, and absolute maximum daily\n precipitation value for each time window). For the partial brood loss\n analysis, we included variables for the 11 day incubation window and 7 day\n window between hatching and nestling banding age. However, we used all 5\n time windows for this analysis. For all response variables assessed at the\n nest level, we used a similar approach to identify and exclude correlated\n predictor variables as described for population-level analyses. We used\n AIC to compare an a priori set of candidate models. We first constructed\n single variable models; based on rankings for these models, we then\n systematically built models containing more than one variable.

For the selected prairie-chicken, we selected four\n GPS locations from a recent day with similar weather conditions (Figure\n 1). Locations were selected such that two GPS locations occurred during\n the morning active period (6:30 – 10:30) and two GPS locations were\n recorded during the afternoon refuge period (12:30 – 16:30). To account\n for the fact that changing weather conditions throughout the day could\n influence invertebrate activity and thermal conditions at a site, we\n divided our thermal and invertebrate data collection efforts into two\n sampling periods that matched the two activity periods (Figure 1). We then\n randomly assigned one telemetry location from the active period and one\n telemetry location from the refuge period to be sampled during the morning\n sample period (6:30-10:30). The remaining two points from that day (one\n from the active period and one from the refuge period) were assigned to be\n sampled during the afternoon sample period (12:30-16:30; Figure 1). The\n actual sampling of vegetation, thermal environment, and food resources\n (insects) occurred within 3-4 days of the day the telemetry locations were\n recorded (mean =3.74 days). This sampling methodology allowed us to assess\n thermal conditions and invertebrate resources under ambient weather\n conditions similar to when the individual was actually at the location as\n well as the period of the day that the prairie-chicken was not present at\n a location.   To account for error associated with the transmitters (up to\n 18 meters), we established sampling arrays consisting of nine sample\n points around each of the used GPS locations where vegetation and thermal\n measurements would occur. The use of multiple sampling points per site\n allowed us to characterize the average vegetation and thermal conditions\n available at a given location. We delineated the area around each\n telemetry location into four quadrants using two perpendicular 36-meter\n transects (2x the error of the transmitters) that intersected at the\n telemetry location and were aligned with the cardinal directions. In\n addition to a sample point at the telemetry location (center of the plot),\n we established two sample points in each of the four quadrants that were\n located at a random distance (1-6 meters) and cardinal direction from the\n center of the quadrant for a total of 9 sample points per telemetry point.\n All subsequent vegetation and temperature measurements occurred at these\n nine sample points for each plot.  We estimated thermal conditions at\n prairie-chicken locations using black-bulb temperature probes. Black-bulb\n temperature incorporates information about ambient temperature, solar\n radiation, wind, and convective heating into a single temperature\n measurement providing a more accurate approximation of what an organism\n experiences compared to ambient conditions alone (Bakken 1992). The\n black-bulb temperature probes consisted of a temperature sensor placed in\n the center of a 101.6mm diameter, 20-gauge steel sphere painted matte\n black that was connected to a HOBO data logger (U12-008, Onset\n Corporation, Bourn, Massachusetts, USA; Guthery et al. 2005). We deployed\n black-bulb sensors at all nine sample locations at both telemetry\n locations (one active, one refuge location) assigned to a sampling period\n and programed the data loggers to record a temperature reading every\n minute for the duration of the four-hour sample period. Black-bulb sensors\n were placed on the ground or the surface of the litter layer at the base\n of any vegetation structure directly above the sample point. If no plants\n were above the sample point the black-bulb was placed in the open. While\n the thermal sensors were recording at each prairie-chicken location, we\n used sweep-net transects to sample the invertebrate community along the\n two perpendicular transects used to delineate the plots. While sweep-net\n samples may underestimate certain orders of insects, we choose this method\n as we felt it provided an adequate index of the overall availability of\n invertebrates for prairie-chickens, particularly insect orders that are\n known to be important for prairie-chickens (Orthoptera and Lepidoptera).\n To account for changing invertebrate activity throughout the day, we timed\n our sweep net samples based on the timestamps from the used\n prairie-chicken telemetry locations. For example, at locations where the\n sampling period matched the telemetry location time (ex. an active\n location sampled during the morning sampling period), we conducted sweep\n net samples within 30 minutes of the approximate time the prairie-chicken\n had previously been at the location. At locations where the\n prairie-chicken activity period did not match the sampling period (ex. an\n afternoon refuge location sampled in the morning sampling period), we\n conducted the sweep-net samples two hours before or after the other\n sweep-net sample for a given sampling period. The two-hour delay between\n samples ensured sweep net transects corresponded approximately to the time\n the prairie-chicken was at the location and to ensure the samples were\n evenly spaced throughout the four-hour sampling period. To perform\n sweep-net samples, we walked each transect at a moderate pace, taking one\n sweep of the sweep-net with each step (Doxon et al. 2011). We transferred\n sweep-net samples to plastic bags and stored them in a freezer until they\n could be sorted. We sorted invertebrate specimens to the level of order\n and size class (eg., 0-5 mm, 6-10 mm, etc.) for each sample and we\n recorded the total number of insects and mass (grams) to estimate\n abundance and biomass for each order and size class combination at a\n location. After the thermal sensors had been removed from a site, we\n collected vegetation data at each of the nine sample points. We centered a\n 0.5 m2 vegetation sampling frame over each point where the black-bulb\n temperature sensor was located, and in each frame, we estimated the\n percent cover of grass, sericea lespedeza (an introduced invasive forb),\n forbs (excluding sericea), shrub, litter, and bare ground using standard\n Daubenmire cover classes (Daubenmire 1959). Additionally, we recorded the\n height of the tallest vegetation in the frame (cm), litter depth (cm,\n taken 10 cm west of the black-bulb location) and visual obstruction using\n a Nudd’s profile board (Nudds 1977). Random Landscape Locations To assess\n vegetation, thermal conditions and invertebrate availability across the\n landscape, we collected the same suite of data collected at\n prairie-chicken locations at random sampling locations that were\n stratified over the three time since fire categories (0-12 months post\n fire, 13-24 months post fire, and &gt;24 month post fire). Each random\n site was composed of a cluster of four locations. We generated clusters by\n generating a single starting location followed by three additional points\n that were a random direction and distance from the previous location, with\n the restriction that random points must be &gt;36 meters apart and\n within the same time since fire patch as the first random point. Distances\n between sample locations were based on distributions of observed distances\n between sequential prairie-chicken telemetry locations. Within each\n cluster of 4 random locations, we randomly assigned two of the locations\n to be sampled during the morning sampling period and two locations were\n assigned to the afternoon sampling period. Sampling at each of the random\n locations followed the same sampling designs as that used at\n prairie-chicken locations."],"descriptionType":["Methods"]},{"description":["The data is organized into three csv files with a file for the vegetation\n data, thermal, data, and invertebrate data.

The column\n Location.type2 divides these point types further into prairie-chicken\n locations recorded during the morning active period (Brood.AM, Adult.AM),\n prairie-chicken locations recorded in the afternoon refuge period\n (Brood.PM, Adult.PM) or a random location in each of the three time since\n fire classes (0=random location in patches 0-12 months post fire, 1=random\n location in patches 13-24 months post-fire, 2=random locations &gt;24\n months post fire).  Sample.period indicates if the data was recorded in\n the morning sampling period (AM) or afternoon sample period (PM).  The\n columns band.random and chicken.date indicate different sampling clusters\n (sets of four telemetry locations or four random locations). Each\n band.random/chicken.date combination will have four values in\n the chicken.time column that indicates which sample location from the\n sample cluster the data belongs to. For prairie-chicken locations these\n values in the chicken.time column also indicate the approximate time the\n GPS location was recorded, but for random locations these values are\n randomly assigned.   For the vegetation data unique combinations\n for quadrant and port indicates unique sample points at a sample location.\n For each location there should be 5 values in quadrant (center, NW, NE,\n SW, SE), that have a corresponding value for port that indicates one of\n two points in a quadrant. Vegetation data is found in columns K:T. \n Grasslike=% cover of grass, Forb=%cover of forbs, litter=% cover of\n Litter, bare=% cover of bare ground, and shrub=% cover of shrubs.

Although phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI)\n genotype was significantly associated with variation in hatching time of\n resting eggs, contrary to prior work with less rigorous designs, allelic\n variation at the PGI locus did not explain variation in P content and PUE\n of Daphnia, indicating that such quantitative traits are under polygenic\n control. 6. Together, these results suggest that although there is\n considerable genetic scope for variation in key ecologically-relevant\n traits, such as P content and efficiency of P use, these traits are likely\n under strong stabilizing selection, most likely due to selection on growth\n rate and size.

the tendency to return to previously visited locations – termed\n ‘site fidelity’ – is common in animals, the cause of this behaviour is not\n well understood. One hypothesis is that site fidelity is shaped by an\n animal’s environment, such that animals living in landscapes with\n predictable resources have stronger site fidelity. Site fidelity may also\n be conditional on the success of animals’ recent visits to that location,\n and it may become stronger with age as the animal accumulates experience\n in their landscape. Finally, differences between species, such as the way\n memory shapes site attractiveness, may interact with environmental drivers\n to modulate the strength of site fidelity.  We compared inter-year site\n fidelity in 669 individuals across eight ungulate species fitted with\n GPS-collars and occupying a range of environmental conditions in North\n America and Africa. We used a distance-based index of site fidelity and\n tested hypothesized drivers of site fidelity using linear mixed effects\n models, while accounting for variation in annual range size. Mule deer\n Odocoileus hemionus and moose Alces alces exhibited relatively strong site\n fidelity, while wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus and barren-ground caribou\n Rangifer tarandus granti had relatively weak fidelity. Site fidelity was\n strongest in predictable landscapes where vegetative greening occurred at\n regular intervals (i.e. high temporal contingency). Species differed in\n their response to spatial heterogeneity in greenness (i.e. spatial\n constancy). Site fidelity varied seasonally in some species, but remained\n constant over time in others. Elk employed a ‘win-stay, lose-switch’\n strategy, in which successful resource tracking in the springtime resulted\n in strong site fidelity the following spring. Site fidelity did not vary\n with age in any species tested. Our results provide support for the\n environmental hypothesis, particularly that regularity in vegetative\n phenology shapes the strength of site fidelity. Large unexplained\n differences in site fidelity suggests that other factors, possibly\n species-specific differences in attraction to known sites, contribute to\n variation in the expression of this behaviour. Understanding drivers of\n variation in site fidelity across groups of organisms living in different\n environments provides important behavioural context for predicting how\n animals will respond to environmental change."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["Data were collected using GPS telelmetry by various projects and were\n compiled for this study. We calculated the minimum inter-year distance\n (IYD) as an inverse metric of the strength of site fidelity. This involved\n several processing steps: (1) subsample GPS datasets to daily fix rates,\n and (2) censor GPS data so that site fidelity was calculated up to a\n maximum of one year per individual, and (3) calculated \"iyd_log\"\n by taking the the natural log of the minimum inter-year distance (IYD)\n between the spatial location (xy) for individual i on Julian date j in\n year t and the set of spatial locations within a window of time (w days)\n surrounding that same Julian dates during the previous year t-1.

While variation in body mass and therefore viability of juveniles\n may be explained by genetic and environmental factors, emerging evidence\n points to the gut microbiota as an important factor influencing host\n health. The gut microbiota is known to change during development, but it\n remains unclear whether the microbiome predicts fitness, and if it does,\n at which developmental stage it affects fitness traits. We collected data\n on two traits associated with fitness in wild nestling great tits (Parus\n major): weight and survival to fledging. We characterised the gut\n microbiome using 16S rRNA sequencing from nestling faeces and investigated\n temporal associations between the gut microbiome and fitness traits across\n development at day 8 (D8) and day 15 (D15) post-hatching. We also explored\n whether particular microbial taxa were ‘indicator species’ that reflected\n whether nestlings survived or not. There was no link between mass and\n microbial diversity on D8 or D15. However, we detected a time-lagged\n relationship whereby the microbial diversity at D8 was negatively\n associated with weight at D15, while controlling for weight at D8.\n Indicator species analysis revealed that while several taxa were unique to\n birds that either survived or did not survive, there were no universal\n taxa that were consistently found across all birds within either survival\n group. This suggests that the presence of particular bacterial taxa may be\n sufficient, but not necessary for determining future survival, perhaps\n owing to functional overlap in microbiota. We highlight that measuring\n microbiome-fitness relationships at just one time point may be misleading,\n especially early in life. Instead, microbial-host fitness effects should\n be investigated longitudinally as there may be critical development\n windows in which key microbiota are established and prime host traits\n associated with nestling weight. Pinpointing which features of the gut\n microbial community impact on host fitness, and when during development\n this occurs, will shed light on population level processes and has the\n potential to support conservation."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["Field monitoring and microbiome sampling Birds were sampled from nine nest\n box populations across Co. Cork, Ireland, five of these were\n mixed/deciduous habitats and four were coniferous habitats (see\n O'Shea et al. (2018)). We collected 204 faecal samples from 150\n nestling great tits from 54 nests (see below for the number of samples\n that were successfully sequenced and sample size per developmental stage)\n for 16S rRNA gene sequencing in order to map the gastrointestinal\n microbial communities. During April-June 2016, nest boxes were monitored\n to determine lay dates, hatching dates and nestling survival. Nestlings\n aged 8 days (+/- 1 day) (D8) and 15 days (D15) were placed into sterile\n holding bags inside a heated holding case. Coffee filters were used to\n line the bags in order to soak up uric acid from the faeces, as uric acid\n has the potential to affect downstream sequencing (Khan et al., 1991).\n Samples were collected from nestlings that defaecated naturally within\n 15-20 minutes of being out of the nest before being returned to the nest.\n Although the aim was to have repeated samples for all individuals, not all\n birds survived, and not all birds produced samples within this time limit.\n Faecal sacks were opened using a sterile inoculation loop to release the\n faecal matter and place in a microcentrifuge tube containing 500uL of 100%\n ethanol. Samples were stored at -20oC within 8 hours of collection until\n DNA extraction. D8 birds were weighed, and uniquely individually\n identified by clipping the tip of one of their nails, avoiding the blood\n vessel (commonly known as the “quick”). D15 nestlings were weighed and\n ringed with a unique identifiable metal ring (British Trust for\n Ornithology) and matched against their unique nail clipping. Nestlings for\n which we had repeated samples (i.e. for both D8 and D15) are referred to\n as ‘repeat samples’. DNA Extractions Briefly, DNA was extracted from the\n dried faecal contents of all birds using the Qiagen QIAamp DNA Stool Kit,\n following the \"Isolation of DNA from Stool for Pathogen\n Detection\" protocol (June 2012 edition), with modifications described\n in (Shutt et al., 2020) to accommodate dried avian faeces. A 0.10 - 0.20 g\n aliquot of each faecal sample was added to the kit, alongside two negative\n controls which were carried through to sequencing. The negative controls\n had low sequence reads and were not included in any subsequent analyses.\n We note that no decontamination methods were used, though they can be\n beneficial for samples with low biomass (Eisenhofer et al., 2019).\n Therefore, we recognise that our sequence data may contain some Amplicon\n Sequence Variants (ASVs) from the external environment, rather than the\n gut microbiome, although this should not have systematically biased our\n results. DNA was stored at -20oC. Full extraction methods are described in\n Supporting Information. Illumina MiSeq sequencing Full library preparation\n details are described in Supporting Information and in Davidson et al 2020\n Scientific Reports. Briefly, the V3-V4 variable region of the 16S rRNA\n gene was amplified from the DNA extracts using the 16S metagenomic\n sequencing library protocol (Illumina). The DNA was amplified with primers\n specific to the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene which also incorporates\n the Illumina overhang adaptor. Samples were sequenced on the MiSeq\n sequencing platform (Clinical Microbiomics, Denmark), using a 2 x 300\n cycle kit, following standard Illumina sequencing protocols.\n Bioinformatics and statistical analysis The DADA2 pipeline (Callahan et\n al., 2016) was used to process the raw sequencing data in R version 3.5 (R\n Core Team, 2019). Sequence quality was visually inspected. Sequences were\n trimmed to remove adapters and lower quality reads (median quality scores\n below 25-30 threshold) at the extremities of the sequence and filtered to\n remove sequences with higher than expected errors. Read errors were\n estimated before dereplication. Forward and reverse reads were merged to\n construct 'contig' sequences, these were used to construct a\n sequence table of ASVs, which counts the number of times each unique\n sequence is detected. The previous steps were performed for each run\n separately. Then the separate sequence tables were merged and chimeras\n removed using the 'consensus' method. Taxonomy was assigned to\n each ASV by RDP's Naive Bayes Classifier (Wang et al., 2007) against\n the Silva reference database (version 132)  (Quast et al., 2012). This is\n at 100% sequence identity in contrast to the lower resolution OTU method\n which groups sequences at 97% identity. ASVs allow greater sensitivity and\n specificity, better discrimination of ecological patterns than OTU's\n and are reusable across studies (Callahan et al., 2017). The DADA2 outputs\n were assembled into a single Phyloseq object (McMurdie &amp; Holmes,\n 2013). Sequences identified as mitochondrial or chloroplast were removed.\n Further filtering of samples and ASVs took place in R. Sample completeness\n curves were plotted using vegan (Oksanen et al., 2019) and helped\n determine the lower cut-off for sample reads at 10,000 reads. Low read\n samples (&lt;10000 reads, 9 samples) were removed leaving 195\n (Day-8=81, Day-15=114, repeat samples=41) samples for the analysis.

animals often learn to distinguish their neighbors from\n unfamiliar conspecifics. This cognitive ability facilitates the dear enemy\n effect, where individuals respond less aggressively to neighbors than to\n other individuals, and is hypothesized to be adaptive by reducing\n unnecessary aggressive interactions with individuals that are not a threat\n to territory ownership. A key prediction of this hypothesis, that\n individuals with better ability to learn to recognize neighbors should\n have higher fitness, has never been tested. We used a series of song\n playbacks to measure the change in response of male great tits on their\n breeding territories to a simulated establishment of a neighbor on an\n adjacent territory. Males reduced their approach to the speaker and sang\n fewer songs on later repetitions of the playback trials, consistent with a\n dear enemy effect through habituation learning. However, not all males\n discriminated between the neighbor and stranger playbacks at the end of\n the series of trials, and there was evidence that individuals consistently\n differed from one another in performing this discrimination. We monitored\n nests and analyzed offspring paternity to determine male reproductive\n success. Unexpectedly, individuals that learned to recognize their\n neighbors did not have higher reproductive success, and in fact one\n measure, total offspring biomass, was lower for learners. Although the\n general capability to recognize neighbors is most likely adaptive, we\n speculate that individuals who decrease their responsiveness to familiar\n neighbors too quickly may be at a disadvantage, perhaps leading to\n selection for slower dear enemy recognition learning."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[{"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"funderName":["European Research Council"],"awardNumber":["617509"],"funderIdentifier":["https://ror.org/0472cxd90"],"funderIdentifierType":["ROR"]},{"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"funderName":["Science Foundation Ireland"],"awardNumber":["14/ERC/B3118"],"funderIdentifier":["https://ror.org/0271asj38"],"funderIdentifierType":["ROR"]}],"url":["https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.1zcrjdfqg"],"contentUrl":{},"metadataVersion":[5],"schemaVersion":["http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4"],"source":["mds"],"isActive":[true],"state":["findable"],"reason":{},"viewCount":[115],"downloadCount":[7],"referenceCount":[0],"citationCount":[0],"partCount":[0],"partOfCount":[0],"versionCount":[0],"versionOfCount":[0],"created":["2020-09-18T14:39:37Z"],"registered":["2020-09-18T14:39:40Z"],"published":{},"updated":["2024-04-10T20:01:51Z"]},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":["dryad.dryad"],"type":["clients"]}}}},{"id":["10.5061/dryad.z08kprr9s"],"type":["dois"],"attributes":{"doi":["10.5061/dryad.z08kprr9s"],"identifiers":[],"creators":[{"name":["Moen, Daniel"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Daniel"],"familyName":["Moen"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[{"schemeUri":["https://orcid.org"],"nameIdentifier":["https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1120-0043"],"nameIdentifierScheme":["ORCID"]}]},{"name":["Ravelojaona, Rojo"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Rojo"],"familyName":["Ravelojaona"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of Antananarivo"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/02w4gwv87"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Hutter, Carl"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Carl"],"familyName":["Hutter"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Louisiana State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/05ect4e57"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Wiens, John"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["John"],"familyName":["Wiens"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of Arizona"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/03m2x1q45"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]}],"titles":[{"title":["Testing for adaptive radiation: a new approach applied to Madagascar frogs"]}],"publisher":["Dryad"],"container":{},"publicationYear":[2020],"subjects":[{"subject":["Mantellidae"]},{"subject":["locomotor performance"]},{"subject":["comparative method"]},{"subject":["multivariate rates of evolution"]}],"contributors":[],"dates":[{"date":["2021-09-16T01:01:01Z"],"dateType":["Issued"]},{"date":["2021-08-02T00:00:00Z"],"dateType":["Available"]}],"language":["en"],"types":{"ris":["DATA"],"bibtex":["misc"],"citeproc":["dataset"],"schemaOrg":["Dataset"],"resourceType":["dataset"],"resourceTypeGeneral":["Dataset"]},"relatedIdentifiers":[{"relationType":["IsCitedBy"],"relatedIdentifier":["10.1098/rspb.2013.2156"],"relatedIdentifierType":["DOI"]},{"relationType":["IsCitedBy"],"relatedIdentifier":["10.1093/sysbio/syv073"],"relatedIdentifierType":["DOI"]},{"relationType":["IsCitedBy"],"relatedIdentifier":["10.1111/evo.14328"],"relatedIdentifierType":["DOI"]},{"relationType":["IsCitedBy"],"relatedIdentifier":["10.1111/evo.14328"],"relatedIdentifierType":["DOI"]},{"relationType":["IsDerivedFrom"],"relatedIdentifier":["10.5281/zenodo.5148766"],"relatedIdentifierType":["DOI"]}],"relatedItems":[],"sizes":[["4163950 bytes"]],"formats":[],"version":["8"],"rightsList":[{"rights":["Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal"],"rightsUri":["https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode"],"schemeUri":["https://spdx.org/licenses/"],"rightsIdentifier":["cc0-1.0"],"rightsIdentifierScheme":["SPDX"]}],"descriptions":[{"description":["Adaptive radiation is a key topic at the intersection of ecology and\n evolutionary biology.

We find that mantellids potentially pass our test for\n accelerated rates of evolution for shape, but not for size, performance,\n or diversification. Our results demonstrate that clades can have\n accelerated phenotypic evolution without rapid diversification (dubbed\n “adaptive non-radiation”). We also highlight general issues in testing for\n adaptive radiation, including taxon sampling and the problem of including\n another adaptive radiation in the comparison clades. Finally, we suggest\n that similar tests should be conducted on other putative adaptive\n radiations on Madagascar, comparing their evolutionary rates to those of\n related clades outside Madagascar.

While the influence of heterogeneity\n on species diversity and abundance is well documented, how heterogeneity\n influences the distribution and arrangement of important resources across\n a landscape is still unclear. In particular, the mechanistic relationship\n between temperature and heterogeneity remains to be explored.\n Heterogeneity in vegetation structure and composition is often cited as\n important drivers of the near ground thermal environment. Due to a\n relative lack of comparative studies across landscapes that differ in\n their degree of vegetation heterogeneity, we lack an understanding of the\n underlying mechanisms that drive variation in the thermal environment. To\n better understand this relationship, we assessed the thermal environment\n in nine grasslands that differ in their degree of structural and\n compositional heterogeneity. At the landscape level, we used a variance\n partitioning approach with linear mixed models to assess the link between\n four different metrics of vegetation heterogeneity and temperature\n variability. At the microsite (individual I-buttons) level, we used\n piecewise Structural Equations Models to assess the fine scale drivers of\n temperature in these landscapes, and developed a causal model describing\n the relationship between vegetation variables and temperature. We found\n that landscape temperature variance was strongly related to diversity of\n plant functional group, heterogeneity in plant species composition, and\n variation in vegetation height. At finer scales, species richness,\n vegetation height, and overhead obstruction were the best predictors of\n temperature once weather was accounted for. Additionally, vegetation\n composition variables primarily had an indirect influence on fine scale\n temperature. These results suggest that scale has a strong influence on\n the observed relationship between temperature variance and different\n metrics of grassland heterogeneity. Our results provide strong support for\n the role of landscape heterogeneity in shaping the thermal landscape, and\n offer insights into the possible impacts of habitat homogenization on the\n thermal environment."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["We sampled the thermal environment and vegetation in September of 2019.\n This month was selected for sampling as September is characterized by warm\n and stable weather patterns, meaning patterns of thermal heterogeneity\n would likely be the most pronounced and easily detected if they existed.\n Additionally, September is at the peak of annual biomass accumulation and\n most perennial plants are identifiable and available to sample during this\n time. To sample thermal conditions, we generated 30 random locations\n (hereafter referred to as microsites) within each of the nine grassland\n landscapes with the restrictions that each site had to be greater than 50\n meters from woodland borders to minimize the effect of shading, and at\n least 10 meters from the next closest sample point. We used Maxim\n Integrated data loggers (Maxim Integrates Products, Sunnyville,\n California, USA; hereafter, I-button) to collect thermal data. We secured\n each I-button to a steel spike using double-sided mounting tape, and we\n drove the spikes into the ground such that each I-button was approximately\n 5-10 centimeters above the ground surface. We did this to avoid insulation\n of the I-buttons by grass litter at ground level, allowing us to better\n characterize the effects near ground vegetation structure. Field tests\n were performed before data collection to ensure that the steel spikes had\n minimal effect on I-button data. Each I-button was programmed to record\n temperature every 15 minutes. We selected days that had minimal to low\n cloud cover, no precipitation, and near average ambient temperatures to\n collect thermal data. Each thermal sample period was 48 hours in length so\n that we could capture a wider range of weather conditions within and\n across sample days. We randomly assigned one grassland from each grassland\n type (one grassland with low, moderate, and high heterogeneity) to one of\n three sample groups, and we collected thermal data at all three grasslands\n in each sample group simultaneously. We did this to minimize variation in\n weather conditions among the three grassland types. We used onsite weather\n stations at both the Stillwater and Perkins sites to compare ambient\n temperature to the I-button temperatures (Oklahoma Mesonet Stations; Brock\n et al. 1995). After collection of the temperature data was complete, we\n revisited each site to collect vegetation measurements to assess\n vegetation composition, structure, and plant diversity at the location of\n each I-button. At each site, we centered a standard 20 x 50 cm Daubenmire\n frame over the I-button location and recorded the percent cover of plant\n functional group (grass, litter, forb, and shrub) and bare ground, and we\n identified and recorded every plant species observed within the frame.\n Forbs are defined as herbaceous (non-woody) broad leaved plants. To assess\n vegetation structure, we recorded plant height directly over the I-button\n site and four angle of obstruction measurements. Angle of obstruction\n provides an index of the amount of cover directly above a point, which\n would influence the amount of solar radiation and airflow at a site. We\n measured the angle of obstruction by attaching a digital level to a meter\n stick and tilting the digital level at an angle until it came into contact\n with the vegetation layer (Carroll et al. 2016). We recorded an angle of\n obstruction measurement in each of four cardinal directions at each site,\n and we averaged the four obstruction measurements to obtain a single\n overhead obstruction metric per site (Carroll et al. 2016)."],"descriptionType":["Methods"]},{"description":["Temperature data and vegetation data was collected in 9 pastures with each\n pasture having 25-30 sample locations.

However, these assumptions are rarely tested\n because such tests require intermediate forms, which are often extinct. In\n vertebrates, the evolution of an elongate, limbless body is generally\n hypothesized to facilitate locomotion in fossorial and/or cluttered\n habitats. However, these hypotheses remain untested because few studies\n examine the locomotion of species ranging in body form from tetrapod to\n snake-like. Here, we address these functional hypotheses by testing\n whether trade-offs exist between locomotion in surface, fossorial, and\n cluttered habitats in Australian Lerista lizards, which include multiple\n intermediate forms. We found that snake-like species penetrated sand\n substrates faster than more lizard-like species, representing the first\n direct support of the adaptation to fossoriality hypothesis. In contrast,\n body form did not affect surface locomotion or locomotion through\n cluttered leaf litter.

Given that the jumping power of some species is up\n to five times higher than typical muscle power, power amplification by\n elastic elements is suggested to explain this discrepancy. However, the\n ecological reasons for this variation in jumping power are unclear. One\n hypothesis is that small jumpers are limited by the time available to\n accelerate their body during take-off, leading to small species needing\n greater power production than larger species to achieve similar jumping\n performance. Another (non-mutually exclusive) hypothesis is that the\n microhabitat species inhabit may drive variation through trade-offs with\n performance in microhabitat-specific, non-jumping behaviors.  2. We\n compared jumping power across 68 anuran species that were diverse in\n evolutionary relationships, microhabitat use, and body mass. We used\n phylogenetic comparative methods to compare the role of microhabitat and\n body mass in explaining variation in jumping power across species.  3. We\n found the strongest support for a model that included two factors and\n their interaction. First, as body mass increased, jumping power decreased.\n Second, species that burrowed showed lower jumping power than species that\n did not burrow. Third, the interaction between body mass and burrowing\n behavior showed that jumping power declines more rapidly with body mass in\n burrowing species than non-burrowing species.  4. The effect of body mass\n suggests that interspecific variation in jumping power might be partly\n explained by scaling relationships. Anurans with small body mass may be\n able to achieve similar locomotor performance (e.g. takeoff velocity) as\n those with larger body mass, by more effectively amplifying muscle power.\n Additionally, the effect of burrowing behavior suggests that species that\n use hindlimbs to burrow may experience a reduction in their ability to\n generate jumping power.

The effects of stressors on\n populations are typically studied in homogeneous, non-spatial settings.\n However, most populations in nature are spatially distributed over\n environmentally heterogeneous landscapes with spatially-restricted\n dispersal. Little is known about the effects of stressors in these more\n realistic settings. Here, we combine laboratory experiments with novel\n mathematical theory to rigorously investigate how a stressor’s\n physiological effect and spatial distribution interact with dispersal to\n influence population dynamics.

We experimentally test this prediction on\n spatially-distributed populations of budding yeast, Saccharomyces\n cerevisiae . We find that the antibiotic, cycloheximide, increases yeast\n death rate but reduces growth rate and yield. Consistent with our\n mathematical predictions, we observe that a homogeneous spatial\n distribution of cycloheximide minimizes the total equilibrium size of\n experimental metapopulations, with the magnitude of the effect depending\n predictably on dispersal rate and geographic pattern of antibiotic\n heterogeneity.

Collisions with buildings, and windows in\n particular, are a top bird mortality source, annually causing 365-988\n million fatalities in the United States. Correlates of window collision\n rates have been studied at the scale of entire buildings and in relation\n to the surrounding landscape, and most studies have only assessed\n correlates for all birds combined without considering season- and\n species-specific risk factors. In Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA, we conducted\n bird collision surveys at 16 buildings to assess building structural-,\n vegetation-, and land cover-related collision correlates. Unlike past\n studies, we focused at the scale of individual building façades, and in\n addition to considering correlates for total collisions, we assessed\n correlates for different seasons and separately for eight collision-prone\n species. Several façade-related features, including proportional glass\n coverage, façade length, and façade height, were positively associated\n with total collisions and collisions for most separate seasons and\n species. Total collisions were also greater at alcove-shaped façades than\n flat, curved, and portico-shaped façades. We found that collision\n correlates varied among seasons (e.g., surrounding lawn cover important in\n summer and fall, but not spring) and among species (e.g., surrounding\n impervious cover positively and negatively related to collisions of\n Painted Bunting and American Robin, respectively). Given the importance of\n glass proportion, collision reduction efforts should continue to focus on\n minimizing and/or treating glass surfaces on new and existing buildings.\n Our species and season-specific assessments indicate that management of\n some collision risk factors may not be equally effective for all seasons\n and species.

The applicability\n of an Asteraceae family-specific Hyb-Seq method and the outcomes of\n different phylogenetic analyses are assessed. Methods: Hyb-Seq data from\n 112 Asteraceae samples were organized into groups at different taxonomic\n levels (tribe, genus, and species). For each group, datasets of\n non-paralogous loci were built and proportions of parsimony informative\n characters estimated. The impacts of the analyzing alternative datasets,\n removing long branches and type of analysis on tree resolution and\n inferred topologies were investigated in tribe Cichorieae. Results:\n Alignments of the Asteraceae-wide Hyb-Seq locus set were parsimony\n informative at all taxonomic levels. Each genus contained uniquely\n non-paralogous loci within their respective tribes. Levels of resolution\n and topologies inferred at shallower nodes differed depending on the locus\n dataset and the type of analysis, and were affected by the presence of\n long branches. Discussion: The approach used to build a Hyb-Seq locus\n dataset and methodological artefacts, such as long branch attraction,\n influence resolution and topologies inferred in phylogenetic analyses. The\n Astereaceae Hyb-Seq probe set is applicable at multiple taxonomic depths\n and therefore probe sets do not necessarily need to be lineage specific."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["Trimming approach testing of supercontig (exon + flanking intron region)\n alignmentsTwo trimming approaches were assessed for two datasets:\n Cichorieae wide and Picris hieracioides species complex in order to select\n an approach for all other datasets (see Tables 1 and 2 Jones et al. 2019\n APPS). Trimal v. 1.4 (Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009) was used to remove\n spurious sequences from each alignment in all datasets. The following two\n trimming approaches were assessed: 1, “strict” - resoverlap and\n -seqoverlap were set to 0.75 and 0.80 respectively and 2, “less-strict” -\n resoverlap and -seqoverlap were set to 0.65 and 70, respectively. In\n addition, we used the -gappyout parameter, which efficiently removes\n poorly aligned regions (Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009). We manually\n checked ~30 alignments from each dataset and found that the “less-strict”\n approach described above generated reliable alignments and minimized\n numbers of samples that needed to be removed. Therefore, all other sample\n groups were subject to the following parameters in trimal: -resoverlap and\n –seqoverlap = 0.65 and 70.

We examined MHC variation in populations\n of the livebearing fish Poecilia mexicana and characterized their parasite\n communities. Poecilia mexicana populations in the Cueva del Azufre system\n are locally adapted to darkness and the presence of toxic hydrogen\n sulfide, and represent highly divergent ecotypes or incipient species.\n Parasite communities differed significantly across populations, and\n populations with higher parasite loads had higher levels of diversity at\n class II MHC genes. However, despite different parasite communities,\n marked divergence in adaptive traits and in neutral genetic markers, we\n found MHC alleles to be remarkably similar among host populations. Our\n findings indicate that balancing selection from parasites maintains\n immunogenetic diversity of hosts, but this process does not promote MHC\n divergence in this system. On the contrary, we suggest that balancing\n selection on immunogenetic loci may outweigh divergent selection causing\n divergence, thereby hindering host divergence and speciation.

The fundamental tradeoff between carbon gain and water loss has long\n been predicted as an evolutionary driver of plant strategies across\n environments. Nonetheless, challenges in measuring carbon gain and water\n loss in ways that integrate over leaf lifetime have limited our\n understanding of the variation in and mechanistic bases of this tradeoff.\n Furthermore, the microevolution of plant traits within species versus the\n macroevolution of strategies among closely related species may not be\n same, and accordingly, the latter must be addressed using comparative\n phylogenetic analyses. 2. Here we introduce the concept of ‘integrated\n metabolic strategy’ (IMS) to describe the ratio between carbon isotope\n composition (δ13C) and oxygen isotope composition above source water\n (Δ18O) of leaf cellulose. IMS is a measure of a leaf-level conditions that\n integrate several mechanisms contributing to carbon gain (δ13C) and water\n loss (Δ18O) over leaf lifespan, with larger values reflecting higher\n metabolic efficiency and hence less of a trade-off. We tested how IMS\n evolves among closely related yet ecologically diverse milkweed species,\n and subsequently addressed phenotypic plasticity in response to water\n availability in species with divergent IMS. 3. IMS varied strongly among\n 20 Asclepias species when grown under controlled conditions, and\n phylogenetic analyses demonstrate species-specific tradeoffs between\n carbon gain and water loss. Larger IMS values were associated with species\n from dry habitats, with larger carboxylation capacity, smaller stomatal\n conductance and smaller leaves; smaller IMS was associated with wet\n habitats, smaller carboxylation capacity, larger stomatal conductance and\n larger leaves. The evolution of IMS was dominated by changes in species’\n demand for carbon (δ13C) more so than water conservation (Δ18O). Although\n some individual physiological traits showed phylogenetic signal, IMS did\n not. 4. In response to experimental decreases in soil moisture, three\n species maintained similar IMS across levels of water availability because\n of proportional increases in δ13C and Δ18O (or little change in either),\n while one species increased IMS due to disproportional changes in δ13C\n relative to Δ18O. 5.

domestication and development of cattle has considerably impacted\n human societies, but the histories of cattle breeds have been poorly\n understood especially for African, Asian, and American breeds. Using\n genotypes from 43,043 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphism markers\n scored in 1,543 animals, we evaluate the population structure of 134\n domesticated bovid breeds. Regardless of the analytical method or sample\n subset, the three major groups of Asian indicine, Eurasian taurine, and\n African taurine were consistently observed. Patterns of geographic\n dispersal resulting from co-migration with humans and exportation are\n recognizable in phylogenetic networks. All analytical methods reveal\n patterns of hybridization which occurred after divergence. Using 19\n breeds, we map the cline of indicine introgression into Africa. We infer\n that African taurine possess a large portion of wild African auroch\n ancestry, causing their divergence from Eurasian taurine. We detect\n exportation patterns in Asia and identify a cline of Eurasian\n taurine/indicine hybridization in Asia. We also identify the influence of\n species other than Bos taurus in the formation of Asian breeds. We detect\n the pronounced influence of Shorthorn cattle in the formation of European\n breeds.

process of ecological speciation drives the evolution of locally\n adapted and reproductively isolated populations in response to divergent\n natural selection. In Southern Mexico, several lineages of the freshwater\n fish species of the genus Poecilia have independently colonized toxic,\n hydrogen sulfide-rich springs. Even though ecological speciation processes\n are increasingly well understood in this system, aligning the taxonomy of\n these fish with evolutionary processes has lagged behind. While some\n sulfide spring populations are classified as ecotypes of Poecilia\n mexicana, others, like P. sulphuraria, have been described as highly\n endemic species. Our study particularly focused on elucidating the\n taxonomy of the long described sulfide spring endemic, Poecilia thermalis\n Steindachner 1863, and investigates if similar evolutionary patterns of\n phenotypic trait divergence and reproductive isolation are present as\n observed in other sulfidic species of Poecilia. We applied a geometric\n morphometric approach to assess body shape similarity to other sulfidic\n and non-sulfidic fish of the genus Poecilia. We also conducted\n phylogenetic and population genetic analyses to establish the phylogenetic\n relationships of P. thermalis and used a population genetic approach to\n determine levels of gene flow among Poecilia from sulfidic and\n non-sulfidic sites. Our results indicate that P. thermalis' body\n shape has evolved in convergence with other sulfide spring populations in\n the genus. Phylogenetic analyses placed P. thermalis as most closely\n related to one population of P. sulphuraria, and population genetic\n analyses demonstrated that P. thermalis is genetically isolated from both\n P. mexicana ecotypes and P. sulphuraria. Based on these findings, we make\n taxonomic recommendations for P. thermalis. Overall, our study verifies\n the role of hydrogen sulfide as a main factor shaping convergent,\n phenotypic evolution and the emergence of reproductive isolation between\n Poecilia populations residing in adjacent sulfidic and non-sulfidic\n environments."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["Microsatellite dataThe excel files contains all raw data from population\n genetic analyses as described in the paper.

The new dollar\n spot warning system was developed from data collected at field sites in\n Madison, WI and Stillwater, OK in 2008 and warning system validation sites\n were established in Madison, WI, Stillwater, OK, Knoxville, TN, State\n College, PA, Starkville, MS, and Storrs, CT between 2011 and 2016. A\n meta-analysis of all site-years was conducted and the most effective\n warning system for dollar spot development consisted of a five-day moving\n average of relative humidity and average daily temperature. Using this\n model the highest effective probability that provided dollar spot control\n similar to that of a calendar-based program across the numerous sites and\n years was 20%. Additional analysis found that the 20% spray threshold\n provided comparable control to the calendar-based program while reducing\n fungicide usage by up to 30%, though further refinement may be needed as\n practitioners implement this warning system in a range of environments not\n tested here. The weather-based dollar spot warning system presented here\n will likely become an important tool for implementing precision disease\n management strategies for future turfgrass managers, especially as\n financial and regulatory pressures increase the need to reduce pesticide\n usage on golf course turfgrass."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["2008 to 2010 5 day MoveAve datasetsFull Data Sets aligned with 5-day\n Moving Average Weather Data2010 FINAL turf model build with Wisc Damon V3\n SASSAS code of Logistic Regression for building Models2010 FINAL turf\n model build with Wisc Damon V3.sas2010 FINAL turf model build with Wisc\n Damon V3 ROC AnalysisAdditional SAS code for model build with ROC curve\n displayFinal Model Build Brief DescriptionA brief text summary of the\n model build approach2016 Data for Primary ANOVA SASRaw, multi-site\n validation data for Meta-analysisPrimary ANOVA GLIMMIXSAS code to obtain\n the primary ANOVA results for meta-analysis2016 Dollar Spot Model\n Meta-AnalysisSAS code for univariate meta-analysis approach to validate\n model as a fungicide spray advisor2016 Meta-Analysis ResultsMet-analysis\n raw data and preliminary meta-analysis results"],"descriptionType":["Other"]}],"geoLocations":[{"geoLocationPlace":["United States of America"]}],"fundingReferences":[],"url":["https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.9m771"],"contentUrl":{},"metadataVersion":[12],"schemaVersion":["http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4"],"source":["mds"],"isActive":[true],"state":["findable"],"reason":{},"viewCount":[259],"downloadCount":[30],"referenceCount":[1],"citationCount":[1],"partCount":[8],"partOfCount":[0],"versionCount":[0],"versionOfCount":[0],"created":["2018-03-05T03:43:18Z"],"registered":["2018-03-05T03:43:19Z"],"published":{},"updated":["2024-04-10T08:17:26Z"]},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":["dryad.dryad"],"type":["clients"]}}}},{"id":["10.5061/dryad.df564"],"type":["dois"],"attributes":{"doi":["10.5061/dryad.df564"],"identifiers":[],"creators":[{"name":["Tanner, Evan P."],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Evan P."],"familyName":["Tanner"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Papes, Monica"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Monica"],"familyName":["Papes"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of Tennessee at Knoxville"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/020f3ap87"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Elmore, R.

To address this, we used a\n well-studied guild (temperate North American quail) and the Maxent\n modeling algorithm to compare model performance of three variable\n selection approaches: correlation/variable contribution (CVC), biological\n (i.e., variables known to affect species abundance), and random. We then\n applied the best approach to forecast potential distributions, under\n future climatic conditions, and analyze future potential distributions in\n light of available abundance data and presence-only occurrence data. To\n estimate species’ distributional shifts we generated ensemble forecasts\n using four global circulation models, four representative concentration\n pathways, and two time periods (2050 and 2070). Furthermore, we present\n distributional shifts where 75%, 90%, and 100% of our ensemble models\n agreed. The CVC variable selection approach outperformed our biological\n approach for four of the six species. Model projections indicated\n species-specific effects of climate change on future distributions of\n temperate North American quail. The Gambel’s quail (Callipepla gambelii)\n was the only species predicted to gain area in climatic suitability across\n all three scenarios of ensemble model agreement. Conversely, the scaled\n quail (Callipepla squamata) was the only species predicted to lose area in\n climatic suitability across all three scenarios of ensemble model\n agreement. Our models projected future loss of areas for the northern\n bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and scaled quail in portions of their\n distributions which are currently areas of high abundance. Climatic\n variables that influence local abundance may not always scale up to\n influence species’ distributions. Special attention should be given to\n selecting variables for ENMs, and tests of model performance should be\n used to validate the choice of variables."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["GAQU_Current_Thresholds_PLOSA ZIP file of 32 discrete TIFF layers\n indicating the current areas of environmental suitability for\n Gambel's quail based on Maxent modeling.GAQU_Future_Thresholds_PLOSA\n ZIP file of 32 discrete TIFF layers indicating the future areas of\n environmental suitability for Gambel's quail based on Maxent\n modeling.MONQ_Current_ThresholdsA ZIP file of 32 discrete TIFF layers\n indicating the current areas of environmental suitability for Montezuma\n quail based on Maxent modeling.MONQ_Future_ThresholdsA ZIP file of 32\n discrete TIFF layers indicating the future areas of environmental\n suitability for Montezuma quail based on Maxent\n modeling.MOUQ_Current_Thresholds_PLOSA ZIP file of 32 discrete TIFF layers\n indicating the current areas of environmental suitability for mountain\n quail based on Maxent modeling.MOUQ_Future_Thresholds_PLOSA ZIP file of 32\n discrete TIFF layers indicating the future areas of environmental\n suitability for mountain quail based on Maxent\n modeling.CAQU_Current_Thresholds_PLOSA ZIP file of 32 discrete TIFF layers\n indicating the current areas of environmental suitability for California\n quail based on Maxent modeling.CAQU_Future_Thresholds_PLOSA ZIP file of 32\n discrete TIFF layers indicating the future areas of environmental\n suitability for California quail based on Maxent\n modeling.NOBO_Current_ThresholdsA ZIP file of 32 discrete TIFF layers\n indicating the current areas of environmental suitability for northern\n bobwhite based on Maxent modeling.NOBO_Future_ThresholdsA ZIP file of 32\n discrete TIFF layers indicating the future areas of environmental\n suitability for northern bobwhite based on Maxent\n modeling.SCQU_Current_Thresholds_PLOSA ZIP file of 32 discrete TIFF layers\n indicating the current areas of environmental suitability for scaled quail\n based on Maxent modeling.SCQU_Future_Thresholds_PLOSA ZIP file of 32\n discrete TIFF layers indicating the future areas of environmental\n suitability for scaled quail based on Maxent modeling.CAQU_MPMModel\n performance metrics (AUC, test omission, and standardized test omission)\n for traditional (correlation/variable contribution [T]), biological (B),\n and five random (R1-R5) variable suites used to model the climatic niche\n of the California quail in Maxent.

We quantified five\n life history traits and the magnitude of their plasticity for 23 amphibian\n species/populations (spanning three families and five genera) when exposed\n to no cues, crushed-egg cues, and predatory crayfish cues. Embryonic\n responses varied considerably among species and phylogenetic signal was\n common among the traits whereas phylogenetic signal was rare for trait\n plasticities. Among trait-evolution models, the Ornstein Uhlenbeck (OU)\n model provided the best fit or was essentially tied with Brownian motion.\n Using the best fitting model, evolutionary rates for plasticities were\n higher than traits for three life history traits and lower for two. These\n data suggest that the evolution of life history traits in amphibian\n embryos is more constrained by a species’ position in the phylogeny than\n life history plasticity.

phagocytophilum is an emerging pathogen that causes human\n granulocytic anaplasmosis. Infection with this zoonotic pathogen affects\n cell function in both vertebrate host and the tick vector, Ixodes\n scapularis. Global tissue-specific response and apoptosis signaling\n pathways were characterized in I. scapularis nymphs and adult female\n midguts and salivary glands infected with A. phagocytophilum using a\n systems biology approach combining transcriptomics and proteomics.\n Apoptosis was selected for pathway-focused analysis due to its role in\n bacterial infection of tick cells. The results showed tissue-specific\n differences in tick response to infection and revealed differentiated\n regulation of apoptosis pathways. The impact of bacterial infection was\n more pronounced in tick nymphs and midguts than in salivary glands,\n probably reflecting bacterial developmental cycle. All apoptosis pathways\n described in other organisms were identified in I. scapularis, except for\n the absence of the Perforin ortholog. Functional characterization using\n RNA interference showed that Porin knockdown significantly increases tick\n colonization by A. phagocytophilum. Infection with A. phagocytophilum\n produced complex tissue-specific alterations in transcript and protein\n levels. In tick nymphs, the results suggested a possible effect of\n bacterial infection on the inhibition of tick immune response. In tick\n midguts, the results suggested that A. phagocytophilum infection inhibited\n cell apoptosis to facilitate and establish infection through up-regulation\n of the JAK/STAT pathway. Bacterial infection inhibited the intrinsic\n apoptosis pathway in tick salivary glands by down-regulating Porin\n expression that resulted in the inhibition of Cytochrome c release as the\n anti-apoptotic mechanism to facilitate bacterial infection. However, tick\n salivary glands may promote apoptosis to limit bacterial infection through\n induction of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. These dynamic changes in\n response to A. phagocytophilum in I. scapularis tissue-specific\n transcriptome and proteome demonstrated the complexity of the tick\n response to infection and will contribute to characterize gene regulation\n in ticks."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["File nymphs_replica 1.raw.zipThis file contains the mass spectrometry data\n of iTRAQ labeled nymph sample (A. phagocytophilum-infected and uninfected\n control) replicate 1 (RAW.ZIP).

The asterisci were smaller and also\n exhibited small otoconia on their surface, but much less than the\n sagittae. The lapilli were oriented laterally, in contrast to the sagittae\n and asterisci that were oriented vertically, with a hump on the dorsum and\n very large otoconia on the lateral surface that appeared to fuse into the\n main otolith as the fish grew. Based on size measurements and ring counts\n in all three pairs of otoliths from known-age Alligator Gar sampled weekly\n through 91 days after hatch (N =101), we developed regression models to\n examine otolith growth and predict age. All relationships were significant\n and highly explanatory (r² ≥ 0.93), but the strongest relationship between\n otolith and fish size existed for measurements from sagittae (r² = 0.98)\n and age predictions from the lapillus (r² = 0.99). Age prediction models\n all resulted in a slope near unity, indicating that ring deposition\n occurred approximately daily. The first ring in sagittae and lapilli\n corresponded to swim-up whereas the first ring formed in asterisci\n approximately 8 days after swim-up. These results fill a gap in knowledge\n and can aid understanding of evolutionary processes as well as provide\n useful information for management and conservation."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["Alligator gar daily age dataData from daily age estimates, including\n precision, accuracy, and relations between otolith and fish size for\n hatchery-reared Alligator Gar.

It is also known that AM symbioses are\n important for the uptake of essential plant nutrients, which, in turn,\n influences the biomass and nutritional quality of herbivores and their\n predators. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of\n AM symbioses on the biomass of different trophic levels of an ecosystem.\n To do this, we first measured the neutral lipid fatty acid biomarker\n 16:1ω5 to estimate the biomass of AM fungi in a long-term grazing\n exclusion experiment. Then, we used model selection of Bayesian linear\n regressions to infer the primary factors that influence AM fungal biomass.\n Using model selection of different combinations of soil characteristics,\n we selected the best model using the leave-one-out cross-validation\n information criterion. Finally, we used the Madingley model to simulate\n the influence of AM fungi on higher trophic levels. We combined spatially\n explicit information about soil phosphorus and AM fungal biomass to\n explore the emergent patterns of the Serengeti resulting from AM\n symbioses. Our Bayesian analysis indicated that total soil phosphorus was\n the strongest predictor of AM fungal biomass, and there were significant\n interactions with grazing. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal biomass is lowest\n in soil where phosphorus is limited and increases with increasing\n phosphorus concentration. Biomass was also significantly higher in plots\n that were not grazed. The Madingley model indicated that nutritional\n benefits of AM symbioses maintain a substantial proportion of the biomass\n across all trophic levels. Synthesis. Our analysis shows that inputs of\n phosphorus through arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses substantially increase\n the ability of plants to grow and maintain nutritional quality, cascading\n through the biomass of consumers and predators in the ecosystem. Although\n they account for less than 1% of the total modelled biomass, the predicted\n nutritional benefit provided by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increased the\n biomass of macro-organisms in the Serengeti by 48%.

We performed two thermal shock experiments that\n varied in length of heat exposure. Overall trends revealed that younger\n genotypes exhibited higher thermal tolerance than older genotypes; heat\n shock protein (hsp70) expression increased with temperature and varied\n among genotypes, but not across time periods. Our results indicate\n temperature may have been a selective factor on this population, although\n the observed responses may be a function of multifarious selection.

In contrast, hybrid BMR was strongly\n influenced by the direction of the cross: reciprocal F1 hybrids were\n different from each other but indistinguishable from the maternal species.\n In addition, MRc was not significantly different between hybrids and\n either parental species. These patterns indicate that metabolic costs are\n not increased in Onychomys F1 hybrids and, while exposure of\n incompatibilities in F2 hybrids cannot be ruled out, suggests that\n mitonuclear mismatch does not act as a primary barrier to gene flow.\n Maternal matching of BMR is suggestive of a strong effect of mitochondrial\n genotype on metabolism in hybrids.

Among other prey, they attack late-instar\n larvae of the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa spp., an economically important\n pest. Consequently, wolf spiders in transgenic Bt cotton could provide\n significant biological control of Bt-resistant Helicoverpa larvae that\n descend to the soil to pupate. The predator-prey interactions between wolf\n spiders and Helicoverpa could, however, be constrained by the presence of\n alternative prey and intraguild predators. This study used laboratory\n enclosures to analyse the effect of alternative prey on predatory\n selection of the wolf spider Tasmanicosa leuckartii Thorell. The prey\n included another wolf spider Hogna crispipes Koch (potential intraguild\n predator), the ground cricket Teleogryllus commodus Walker (minor pest),\n and Helicoverpa armigera larvae (major pest). We tested if encounter\n rates, prey vulnerability, and prey nutritional content influenced the\n likelihood that a prey was attacked. In three-way food webs, Tasmanicosa\n encountered and attacked Teleogryllus and Helicoverpa in similar\n frequencies. However, in the presence of a competing intraguild predator\n and potential prey (Hogna) in a four-way food web, Tasmanicosa did not\n always attack Teleogryllus at first encounter, but still attacked\n Helicoverpa at each encounter. Helicoverpa (protein-poor) and Hogna\n (protein-rich) were consumed by Tasmanicosa in similar proportions,\n suggesting that Tasmanicosa might benefit from nutrient balance as an\n outcome of diverse prey in this food web. As Teleogryllus (protein rich)\n escapes quicker than Helicoverpa and Hogna, Hogna may be an easier\n protein-rich option than Teleogryllus. Field surveys showed that while\n Teleogryllus was the most common prey, wolf spiders feed on diverse insect\n taxa, as well as other spiders. That Tasmanicosa readily attacked\n Helicoverpa larvae in the presence of alternative prey is an encouraging\n result that supports the potential of Tasmanicosa predation to assist in\n the control of Bt-resistant Helicoverpa larvae and thereby inhibit the\n proliferation and spread of resistance."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["3_way 4_way food websDescribes characteristics of animals and encounter\n and predation outcomes in 3-way and 4-way food websLipid and protein\n analysis dataRaw data on the analysis of protein and lipid contents of\n arthropods in this food webLipid and protein analysis raw data.xlsxPrey of\n wolf spiders in cotton fieldsField observations of spider predation in\n cotton fields"],"descriptionType":["Other"]}],"geoLocations":[{"geoLocationPlace":["Australia"]}],"fundingReferences":[],"url":["https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.pm8p741"],"contentUrl":{},"metadataVersion":[9],"schemaVersion":["http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4"],"source":["mds"],"isActive":[true],"state":["findable"],"reason":{},"viewCount":[211],"downloadCount":[24],"referenceCount":[1],"citationCount":[1],"partCount":[3],"partOfCount":[0],"versionCount":[0],"versionOfCount":[0],"created":["2018-12-26T15:25:07Z"],"registered":["2018-12-26T15:25:08Z"],"published":{},"updated":["2024-04-09T23:54:48Z"]},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":["dryad.dryad"],"type":["clients"]}}}},{"id":["10.5061/dryad.2pn59"],"type":["dois"],"attributes":{"doi":["10.5061/dryad.2pn59"],"identifiers":[],"creators":[{"name":["Davis, Craig A."],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Craig A."],"familyName":["Davis"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Churchwell, Roy T."],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Roy T."],"familyName":["Churchwell"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of Alaska System"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01mtkd993"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Fuhlendorf, Samuel D."],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Samuel D."],"familyName":["Fuhlendorf"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Engle, David M."],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["David M."],"familyName":["Engle"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Hovick, Torre J."],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Torre J."],"familyName":["Hovick"],"affiliation":[{"name":["North Dakota State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/05h1bnb22"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]}],"titles":[{"title":["Data from: Effect of pyric herbivory on source-sink dynamics in grassland birds"]}],"publisher":["Dryad"],"container":{},"publicationYear":[2017],"subjects":[{"subject":["dickcissel"]},{"subject":["Sensitivity Analysis"]},{"subject":["patch-burn grazing management"]},{"subject":["nest survival"]},{"subject":["Ammodramus savannarum"]},{"subject":["fire-grazing interaction"]},{"subject":["grasshopper sparrow"]},{"subject":["grassland management"]},{"subject":["Sturnella magna"]},{"subject":["2004"]},{"subject":["2003"]},{"subject":["Spiza americana"]},{"subject":["eastern meadowlark"]}],"contributors":[],"dates":[{"date":["2017-03-03T00:00:00Z"],"dateType":["Issued"]},{"date":["2017-03-03T00:00:00Z"],"dateType":["Available"]}],"language":["en"],"types":{"ris":["DATA"],"bibtex":["misc"],"citeproc":["dataset"],"schemaOrg":["Dataset"],"resourceType":["dataset"],"resourceTypeGeneral":["Dataset"]},"relatedIdentifiers":[{"relationType":["IsCitedBy"],"relatedIdentifier":["10.1111/1365-2664.12641"],"relatedIdentifierType":["DOI"]}],"relatedItems":[],"sizes":[["125351 bytes"]],"formats":[],"version":["1"],"rightsList":[{"rights":["Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal"],"rightsUri":["https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode"],"schemeUri":["https://spdx.org/licenses/"],"rightsIdentifier":["cc0-1.0"],"rightsIdentifierScheme":["SPDX"]}],"descriptions":[{"description":["Grasslands world-wide provide a host of ecosystem services. In particular,\n these grasslands serve as biodiversity repositories for a myriad of\n imperilled animal species. One such group is grassland birds, which have\n experienced significant declines, predominantly caused by extensive loss\n and degradation of native grasslands. Rangeland management that promotes\n increasing and sustaining livestock production through reducing the\n inherent, disturbance-driven variability that historically occurred in\n grasslands is considered a major contributing factor to these declines. An\n alternative approach to this homogeneous management paradigm attempts to\n restore a shifting mosaic of disturbance patches across the landscape\n through the spatial and temporal interactions of fire and grazing (i.e.\n pyric herbivory). Application of pyric herbivory through patch-burn\n grazing increases overall habitat heterogeneity, likely a critically\n important factor in maintaining and enhancing grassland bird populations.\n We compared reproductive rates and estimates of fecundity of three\n grassland birds nesting in grasslands maintained by traditional and\n patch-burn grazing management paradigms in the Southern Great Plains of\n North America. Additionally, we used a sensitivity analysis approach to\n assess population stability (i.e. λ = 1) and source–sink population\n dynamics under the two management practices. Nest survival for dickcissels\n Spiza americana and grasshopper sparrows Ammodramus savannarum was higher\n in patch-burned grasslands than in traditionally managed grasslands, while\n nest survival for eastern meadowlarks Sturnella magna was higher in\n traditionally managed grasslands than in patch-burned grasslands.\n Dickcissels and grasshopper sparrows responded positively to patch burning\n with source habitats occurring over a wider range of survival rates under\n patch burning than traditional management, while no clear pattern emerged\n in source–sink dynamics of eastern meadowlarks. Synthesis and\n applications. Management strategies such as patch-burn grazing offer\n opportunities to restore landscape heterogeneity to benefit bird\n communities while maintaining livestock production goals. Applying\n patch-burn grazing to rangelands can increase productivity of grassland\n birds and could be effective for reversing the decline of grassland birds\n by providing source habitats more consistently than traditional rangeland\n management. Our results emphasize the utility of using sensitivity\n analyses to determine source–sink population dynamics when evaluating\n management practices. However, land managers should consider that\n source–sink models have shortcomings and designation of a habitat as a\n sink does not necessarily mean the habitat has low conservation

reagents for wild, non-model species are limited or often\n non-existent for many species. 2. In this study, we compare the reactivity\n of a new anti-passerine IgY secondary antibody with existing secondary\n antibodies developed for use with birds. Samples from 41 species from the\n following six avian orders were analysed: Anseriformes (1 family, 1\n species), Columbiformes (1 family, 2 species), Galliformes (1 family, 1\n species), Passeriformes (16 families, 34 species), Piciformes (1 family, 2\n species) and Suliformes (1 family, 1 species). Direct ELISAs were\n performed to detect total IgY using goat anti-passerine IgY, goat\n anti-chicken IgY or goat anti-bird IgY secondary antibodies. 3.The\n anti-passerine antibody exhibited significantly higher IgY reactivity\n compared to the anti-chicken and/or anti-bird antibodies in 80% of the\n passerine families tested. Birds in the order Piciformes (woodpeckers) and\n order Suliformes (cormorants) were poorly detected by all three secondary\n antibodies. A comparison of serum and plasma IgY levels was made within\n the same individuals for two passerine species (house finch and\n white-crowned sparrow), and serum exhibited significantly more IgY than\n the plasma for all three secondary antibodies. This result indicates that\n serum may be preferred to plasma when measuring total antibody levels in\n blood. 4.This study indicates that the anti-passerine IgY secondary\n antibody can effectively be used in immunological assays to detect\n passerine IgY for species in most passerine families and is preferred over\n anti-chicken and anti-bird secondary antibodies for the majority of\n passerine species.

The effects of predation risk on prey\n (nonconsumptive effects, NCEs) and emergent indirect effects on basal\n resources should therefore depend on the ecological context (e.g. resource\n abundance, prey state) in which prey manage growth/predation risk\n tradeoffs. Despite an abundance of behavioral research and theory\n examining state-dependent responses to risk, there is a lack of empirical\n data on state-dependent NCEs and their impact on community-level\n processes. We used a rocky intertidal food chain to test model predictions\n for how resources levels and prey state (age/size) shape the magnitude of\n NCEs. Risk cues from predatory crabs (Carcinus maenas) caused juvenile and\n sub-adult snails (Nucella lapillus) to increase their use of refuge\n habitats and decrease their growth and per capita foraging rates on\n barnacles (Semibalanus balanoides). Increasing resource levels (high\n barnacle density) and prey state (sub-adults) enhanced the strength of\n NCEs. Our results support predictions that NCEs will be stronger in\n resource-rich systems that enhance prey state and suggest that the\n demographic composition of prey populations will influence the role of\n NCEs in trophic cascades. Contrary to theory, however, we found that\n resources and prey state had little to no effect on snails in the presence\n of predation risk. Rather, increases in NCE strength arose because of the\n strong positive effects of resources and prey state on prey foraging rates\n in the absence of risk. Hence, a common approach to estimating NCE\n strength – integrating measurements of prey traits with and without\n predation risk into a single metric – may mask the underlying mechanisms\n driving variation in the strength and relative importance of NCEs in\n ecological communities."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["All dataThe file Matassa&amp;&amp;_1-4.zip includes 4 sequentially\n numbered CSV files containing all the data presented in the manuscript.\n The file numbers correspond to the table and figure numbers in the\n manuscript.Matassa&amp;&amp;files1-4.zip"],"descriptionType":["Other"]}],"geoLocations":[{"geoLocationPlace":["United States of America"]},{"geoLocationPlace":["New England"]},{"geoLocationPlace":["North Atlantic"]},{"geoLocationPlace":["Gulf of Maine"]}],"fundingReferences":[],"url":["https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.7sr33"],"contentUrl":{},"metadataVersion":[21],"schemaVersion":["http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4"],"source":["mds"],"isActive":[true],"state":["findable"],"reason":{},"viewCount":[240],"downloadCount":[23],"referenceCount":[1],"citationCount":[1],"partCount":[1],"partOfCount":[0],"versionCount":[0],"versionOfCount":[0],"created":["2016-01-21T17:25:16Z"],"registered":["2016-01-21T17:25:17Z"],"published":{},"updated":["2024-04-09T22:08:10Z"]},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":["dryad.dryad"],"type":["clients"]}}}},{"id":["10.5061/dryad.nt2211q"],"type":["dois"],"attributes":{"doi":["10.5061/dryad.nt2211q"],"identifiers":[],"creators":[{"name":["Bielski, Christine H."],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Christine H."],"familyName":["Bielski"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of Nebraska - Lincoln"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/043mer456"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Twidwell, Dirac"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Dirac"],"familyName":["Twidwell"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of Nebraska - Lincoln"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/043mer456"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Fuhlendorf, Samuel D."],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Samuel D."],"familyName":["Fuhlendorf"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Wonkka, Carissa L."],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Carissa L."],"familyName":["Wonkka"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of Nebraska - Lincoln"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/043mer456"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Allred, Brady W."],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Brady W."],"familyName":["Allred"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of Montana"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/0078xmk34"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Ochsner, Tyson E."],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Tyson E."],"familyName":["Ochsner"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Krueger, Erik S."],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Erik S."],"familyName":["Krueger"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Carlson, J.

Understanding how extreme drought alters spatial patterns and temporal\n stability in grassland biomass will become increasingly important by the\n end of the century when climate model forecasts suggest drought events\n will occur more frequently.

We assess the robustness of this relationship during one of\n the most severe droughts on modern record in the southern Great Plains. We\n use a long-term pyric herbivory experiment to test whether extreme\n drought: 1) changes patterns of spatial variability in aboveground plant\n biomass among or within local communities, 2) changes the temporal\n stability in aboveground plant biomass and the relationship between\n spatial variability and temporal variability, and 3) changes the\n underlying feedback mechanisms associated with pyric herbivory. Ordination\n revealed a shift from spatially distinct patches before drought to a\n convergence of patches during drought in terms of aboveground plant\n biomass and crude protein. 3. Permutation tests revealed that within-patch\n variability in aboveground plant biomass significantly increased during\n drought compared to pre-drought levels. Temporal stability in aboveground\n plant biomass decreased during drought and indeed corresponded with\n reduced variability in biomass among local communities and increased\n variability within local communities compared to pre-drought levels. 4.\n The results from this study strongly suggest that both positive and\n negative feedback loops responsible for pyric herbivory were maintained by\n scale-switching during periods of extreme drought and further reinforce\n the importance of scale in the study of pattern-process relationships."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["Aboveground Herbaceous Biomass DataFile containing aboveground herbaceous\n biomass measurements for all samples.Time since fire-biomass_Pre and post\n drought.csvForage Quality DataFile containing forage quality measurements\n for all samples.Time since fire-forage quality_Pre and post drought.csv"],"descriptionType":["Other"]}],"geoLocations":[{"geoLocationPlace":["Oklahoma"]},{"geoLocationPlace":["Stillwater"]},{"geoLocationPlace":["Great Plains"]},{"geoLocationPlace":["North America"]}],"fundingReferences":[],"url":["https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.nt2211q"],"contentUrl":{},"metadataVersion":[22],"schemaVersion":["http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4"],"source":["mds"],"isActive":[true],"state":["findable"],"reason":{},"viewCount":[214],"downloadCount":[12],"referenceCount":[1],"citationCount":[1],"partCount":[2],"partOfCount":[0],"versionCount":[0],"versionOfCount":[0],"created":["2018-02-16T17:44:01Z"],"registered":["2018-02-16T17:44:02Z"],"published":{},"updated":["2024-04-09T21:26:31Z"]},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":["dryad.dryad"],"type":["clients"]}}}},{"id":["10.5061/dryad.jq16r"],"type":["dois"],"attributes":{"doi":["10.5061/dryad.jq16r"],"identifiers":[],"creators":[{"name":["Norwood, Bailey"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Bailey"],"familyName":["Norwood"],"affiliation":[],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Depue, Sandra Molly"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Sandra Molly"],"familyName":["Depue"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Lusk, Jayson L."],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Jayson L."],"familyName":["Lusk"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Norwood, F.

Ablation of\n abdominal fat bodies had a strong and persistent effect on energy stores,\n but it did not influence post-breeding survival in any of the three\n reproductive treatments.

Genomic selection (GS) in forestry can substantially reduce\n the length of breeding cycle and increase gain per unit time through early\n selection and greater selection intensity, particularly for traits of low\n heritability and late expression. Affordable next-generation sequencing\n technologies made it possible to genotype large numbers of trees at a\n reasonable cost. Results: Genotyping-by-sequencing was used to genotype\n 1,126 Interior spruce trees representing 25 open-pollinated families\n planted over three sites in British Columbia, Canada. Four imputation\n algorithms were compared (mean value (MI), singular value decomposition\n (SVD), expectation maximization (EM), and a newly derived, family-based\n k-nearest neighbor (kNN-Fam)). Trees were phenotyped for several yield and\n wood attributes. Single- and multi-site GS prediction models were\n developed using the Ridge Regression Best Linear Unbiased Predictor\n (RR-BLUP) and the Generalized Ridge Regression (GRR) to test different\n assumption about trait architecture. Finally, using PCA, multi-trait GS\n prediction models were developed. The EM and kNN-Fam imputation methods\n were superior for 30 and 60% missing data, respectively. The RR-BLUP GS\n prediction model produced better accuracies than the GRR indicating that\n the genetic architecture for these traits is complex. GS prediction\n accuracies for multi-site were high and better than those of single-sites\n while multi-site predictability produced the lowest accuracies reflecting\n type-b genetic correlations and deemed unreliable. The incorporation of\n genomic information in quantitative genetics analyses produced more\n realistic heritability estimates as half-sib pedigree tended to inflate\n the additive genetic variance and subsequently both heritability and gain\n estimates. Principle component scores as representatives of multi-trait GS\n prediction models produced surprising results where negatively correlated\n traits could be concurrently selected for using PCA2 and PCA3.\n Conclusions: The application of GS to open-pollinated family testing, the\n simplest form of tree improvement evaluation methods, was proven to be\n effective. Prediction accuracies obtained for all traits greatly support\n the integration of GS in tree breeding. While the within-site GS\n prediction accuracies were high, the results clearly indicate that\n single-site GS models ability to predict other sites are unreliable\n supporting the utilization of multi-site approach. Principle component\n scores provided an opportunity for the concurrent selection of traits with\n different phenotypic optima."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["PhenotypesTree ID (Site, Family, Tree), height, diameter, volume,\n velocity, Resistograph, Xray (wood density), MoE (modulus of\n elasticity)SNP MI 30%Genotyping-by-sequence imputated SNP file with 30%\n missing data using the mean imputation methodSNP MI\n 60%Genotyping-by-sequence imputated SNP file with 60% missing data using\n the mean imputation method"],"descriptionType":["Other"]}],"geoLocations":[{"geoLocationPlace":["Canada"]},{"geoLocationPlace":["British Columbia"]}],"fundingReferences":[],"url":["https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.8kb37"],"contentUrl":{},"metadataVersion":[25],"schemaVersion":["http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4"],"source":["mds"],"isActive":[true],"state":["findable"],"reason":{},"viewCount":[366],"downloadCount":[29],"referenceCount":[1],"citationCount":[1],"partCount":[3],"partOfCount":[0],"versionCount":[0],"versionOfCount":[0],"created":["2015-04-08T18:44:20Z"],"registered":["2015-04-08T18:44:22Z"],"published":{},"updated":["2024-04-09T16:32:18Z"]},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":["dryad.dryad"],"type":["clients"]}}}},{"id":["10.5061/dryad.12bd9"],"type":["dois"],"attributes":{"doi":["10.5061/dryad.12bd9"],"identifiers":[],"creators":[{"name":["Zhang, Geli"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Geli"],"familyName":["Zhang"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of Oklahoma"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/02aqsxs83"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Biradar, Chandrashekhar M."],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Chandrashekhar M."],"familyName":["Biradar"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Jiangxi Normal University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/05nkgk822"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Xiao, Xiangming"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Xiangming"],"familyName":["Xiao"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of Oklahoma"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/02aqsxs83"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]},{"name":["Fudan University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/013q1eq08"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Dong, Jinwei"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Jinwei"],"familyName":["Dong"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/04t1cdb72"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Zhou, Yuting"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Yuting"],"familyName":["Zhou"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/01g9vbr38"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Qin, Yuanwei"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Yuanwei"],"familyName":["Qin"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of Oklahoma"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/02aqsxs83"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Zhang, Yao"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Yao"],"familyName":["Zhang"],"affiliation":[{"name":["University of Oklahoma"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/02aqsxs83"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Liu, Fang"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Fang"],"familyName":["Liu"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/04t1cdb72"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Ding, Mingjun"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Mingjun"],"familyName":["Ding"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Jiangxi Normal University"],"schemeUri":["https://ror.org"],"affiliationIdentifier":["https://ror.org/05nkgk822"],"affiliationIdentifierScheme":["ROR"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Thomas, Richard J."],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Richard J."],"familyName":["Thomas"],"affiliation":[{"name":["CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems, c/o ICARDA;

A\n frequency analysis of grassland versus sparsely vegetated land\n classification in last 15 years allowed a recognition of persistent desert\n zone (PDZ), persistent grassland zone (PGZ), and transitional zone (TZ).\n The TZ was identified in southern Kazakhstan as one hotspot which was\n vulnerable and unstable for desertification. Furthermore, the trend\n analysis of Enhanced Vegetation Index during thermal growing season\n (EVITGS) was investigated in individual zones using Linear Regression and\n Mann-Kendall approaches. An overall degradation across the area was found;\n moreover, the second desertification hotspot was identified in the\n northern Kazakhstan with significant decreasing in EVITGS, which was\n located in PGZ. Finally, attribution analyses of grassland degradation and\n desertification were conducted by considering precipitation, temperature,\n and three different drought indices. We found persistent droughts were the\n main factor for grassland degradation and desertification in Central Asia.\n Considering both state conversion and gradual within-state change\n processes, this study provided reference information for identification of\n desertification hotspots to support further grassland degradation and\n desertification treatment, and the method could be useful to be extended\n to other regions."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["Spatial distribution of grassland and sparsely vegetated land in Central\n Asia from 2000 to 2014Raster data for annual spatial distribution of\n grassland and sparsely vegetated land in targeted area of Central Asia\n over the period 2000-2014.

midges of the genus Culicoides are known vectors of arboviruses\n affecting human and animal health. However, little is known about\n Culicoides imicola microbiota and its influence on this insect’s biology.\n In this study, the impact of biotic and abiotic factors on C. imicola\n microbiota was characterized using shotgun-metagenomic sequencing of whole\n body DNA samples. Wild-caught C. imicola adult nulliparous females were\n sampled in two locations from Sicily, Italy. The climatic variables of\n temperature and soil moisture from both localities were recorded together\n with potential host blood meal sources. Shared core microbiome among C.\n imicola populations included Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Halomonas,\n Candidatus Zinderia, Propionibacterium, and Schizosaccharomyces. Specific\n and unique taxa were also found in C. imicola from each location,\n highlighting similarities and differences in microbiome composition\n between both populations. DNA and protein identification showed\n differences in host preferences between both populations with Homo sapiens\n and Canis lupus familiaris L. being the preferred blood meal source in\n both locations. A principal component analysis showed that the combined\n effect of host preferences (H. sapiens) and local soil moisture factors\n shape the microbiome composition of wild-caught populations of C. imicola.\n These results contribute to characterizing the role of the microbiome in\n insect adaptation and its utility in predicting geographic expansion of\n Culicoides species with potential implications for the control of\n vector-borne diseases."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["Culicoides_all_fasta_samplesThis file contain all the fasta files from the\n Culicoides

dataset supports the extended abstract submitted to the 24th ARAM Conference at the 2024 AMS Annual Meeting. The data was collected on APR/14/2023 at Marshall Field (CO). It presents weather data from ground-based sensors and an  Unmanned Aerial Weather Measurement System (WxUAS).\n\n#############INSIDE DATA.ZIP##############\n\n- WxUASParticleSizeDistribution - This folder has the four files for the WxUAS particle size distribution profiles. This data was collected with an AlphaSense OPC-N3.

species often drive habitat restoration action; however, management under this paradigm may negatively affect non-target species. Prioritization frameworks which explicitly consider benefits to target species while minimizing consequences for non-target species may drastically improve management strategies. We examined extents to which conifer removal, an approach frequently implemented to restore sagebrush ecosystems, can be conducted without detrimental effects to conifer-associated species, including the imperiled Pinyon Jay (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus). Additionally, we predicted abundance responses for multiple species following simulated conifer removal at sites selected to achieve variable management objectives. We used model-predicted changes in species’ densities following simulated conifer removal to identify optimal removal sites under single species, multi-species (ecosystem), and multi-ecosystem management scenarios. We simulated conifer removal at prioritized sites under these scenarios using an integer linear programming algorithm and evaluated resulting abundances for six songbird species. The resulting maps represent prioritized pixels for conifer removal inside of priority areas for conservation (PACs) which occur within the Utah portion of Bird Conservation Region 16. Sites identified to receive conifer removal treatments which minimize effects to the pinyon jay, under three different budget scenarios, are represented in three raster layers: pija_3.tif, pija_6.tif, pija_9.tif. Sites identified for conifer removal treatments which maximize outcomes for Brewer’s Sparrow are represented in brsp_6.tif. Sites identified for conifer removal treatments which maximize outcomes for sagebrush-associated species; Brewer’s Sparrow (Spizella breweri), Sagebrush Sparrow (Artemisiospiza nevadensis), and Sage Thrasher (Oreoscoptes montanus) are represented in sb_ecosystem_6.tif. Sites identified for conifer removal which minimize negative outcomes for pinyon-juniper associated species; Bewick’s Wren (Thryomanes bewickii), Gray Flycatcher (Empidonax wrightii), and Pinyon Jay are represented in pj_ecosystem_6.tif. Sites identified for conifer removal treatments which maximize outcomes for all six songbird species are represented in multi_ecosystem_6.tif. Sites identified for conifer removal treatments which maximize outcomes for Brewer’s Sparrow, Sagebrush Sparrow, and Sage Thrasher and which weight outcomes for Pinyon Jay three times more heavily than the other species are represented in sb_ecoystem_pijawt_6.tif.

After gas fluxes were expected to equilibrate, approximately 8 hr post pyruvate labeling (~ 6 PM), measurement intervals were decreased to low frequency (50 minutes) and remained at this frequency until measurements were stopped at 48 hr post labeling. For each measurement, the automatic chamber closed over the collar for a total of 10 min (pre-purge, 2.5 min; measurements, 6.5 min; post-purge, 1 min). Fluxes were measured using an automated, multiplexed Licor soil flux system (Licor 8100, Li-8150 16-port multiplexer and Lic 8100-104 Long-Term Chambers with opaque lids, Licor Inc.). The system was coupled to a Picarro G2201-i analyzer (Picarro Inc., Santa Clara, US) to measure CO2 and isotopic composition and a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF 8000, Ionicon Inc. Innsbruck, Austria) for VOCs (including 13C-VOCs). The PTR-ToF-MS sampled the sub-flow from the soil flux system at 30 sccm <em>via<\/em> fluorinated ethylene propylene tubing heated at 60 °C. The drift voltage was 600 V, the drift temperature was 60°C and the drift pressure was 2.2 mbar, resulting in an E/N ratio of 137 Td. The time resolution was 10 ms and the mass range was up to 500 amu. The PTR-ToF was operated in the H3O+ mode, therefore only compounds having proton affinity higher than water (697 kJ/mol) underwent proton-transfer reactions and could be detected on their protonated mass to charge ratio (<em>m/z<\/em>), which includes the vast majority of VOCs . Measured ions were attributed to chemical formulas and specific chemical species based on the exact protonated <em>m/z<\/em>. PTR-TOF data were processed using the software PTRwid. To account for possible variations of the reagent ion signals, measured ion intensities were normalized to the H3O+ counts in combination with the water-cluster ion counts. At midnight, automatic calibrations were performed using standard gas cylinders containing different multi-VOC component calibration mixtures in Ultra-High Purity (UHP) nitrogen (Apel-Riemer Environmental, Inc., Colorado, USA). For a detailed description of the calibration setup see Werner et al. (2021). The concentrations of compounds included in the standard were calculated with an uncertainty of ≤23%. Concentrations of compounds not included in the calibration standard cylinders were calculated by applying the kinetic theory of proton transfer reaction with an uncertainty of ≤50%. Select additional soil experiments were conducted with a Vocus proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF; TOFWERK, AG, Thun, Switzerland) coupled to a custom-built gas chromatograph (GC; Aerodyne Research, Inc., Billerica, MA, USA). The GC contains an integrated two-stage adsorbent-based thermal desorption preconcentration system for <em> in situ<\/em> collection of VOCs prior to separation on the chromatographic column. For preconcentration, a multi-bed (Tenax TA/Graphitized Carbon/Carboxen 1000; Markes International) sorbent tube was used for the first stage of sample collection, this tube is then subjected to a post-collection water purge before the sample was thermally desorbed to a multi-bed focusing trap (Tenax, Carbopack X, Carboxen 1003; Markes International) prior to injection onto the GC column. For this study, the GC was equipped with a 30-m Rxi-624 column (Restek, 0.25 mm ID, 1.4 µm film thickness) which resolves non- to mid-polarity VOCs in the C5 - C12 volatility range prior to ionization in the PTR detector. The GC-PTR sampled from <em>in-situ <\/em>soil gas probes on an alternating timed schedule. The GC-PTR can speciate structural isomers and help identify some unknowns by matching to calibrated retention times. <br> <strong>NMR <\/strong> 1H-NMR bulk metabolite characterization was performed on soil water extracts. Samples (180 µL) were combined with 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane- 5-sulfonate-d6 (DSS-d6) in D2O (20 µL, 5 mM) and thoroughly mixed prior to transfer to 3 mm NMR tubes. Resonances corresponding to 13C labeling were identified by visual inspection, comparing labeled spectra to unlabeled spectra. Once differences were identified, the molecular location and quantification of 13C incorporation was determined by J-coupling pattern analysis and the ‘linefitting’ tool in Mestrenova, respectively. NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer operating at a field strength of 17.6 T (1H ν0 of 750.24 MHz) and equipped with a 5 mm Bruker TCI/CP HCN (inverse) cryoprobe with Z-gradient and at a regulated temperature of 298 K. The one-dimensional 1H spectra were acquired using a nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (noesypr1d) pulse sequence. The 90° H pulse was calibrated prior to the measurement of each sample with a spectral width of 12 ppm and 1024 transients. The NOESY mixing time was 100 ms and the acquisition time was 4 s followed by a relaxation delay of 1.5 s during which presaturation of the water signal was applied. Time domain free induction decays (72114 total points) were zero filled to 131072 total points prior to Fourier transform, followed by exponential multiplication (0.3 Hz line-broadening), and semi-automatic multipoint smooth segments baseline correction. Chemical shifts were referenced to the 11H methyl or 13C signal in DSS-d6 at 0 ppm. The 1D 11H NMR spectra of all samples were processed, assigned and analyzed using Chenomx NMR suite 9.2 (Chenomx Inc.; Edmonton, AB, Canada) with quantification of spectral intensities of compounds in the Chenomx library relative to the internal standard. Candidate metabolites present in each of the complex mixtures were determined by matching chemical shift, J-coupling and intensity information of the experimental signals against signals of the standard metabolites in the Chenomx library. Signal to noise ratios (S/N) were measured using MestReNova v 14.2.014 with the limit of quantification equal to a S/N of 10 and the limit of detection equal to a S/N of 3. Standard 2-D experiments such as 11H / 13C - heteronuclear correlation (HSQC) experiments or 2-D 11H/ 11H Total Correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) experiments further aided corroboration of several metabolite identifications where there was sufficient S/N. <strong>FTICR <\/strong> A 12 Tesla Bruker FTICR mass spectrometer (MS) was used to collect high-resolution mass spectra of WEOC by direct injection for secondary metabolite characterization. Approximately 100 µL of water extract was mixed with methanol (1:2) before injection onto the mass spectrometer to enhance ionization. A standard Bruker electrospray ionization (ESI) source was used to generate negatively charged molecular ions. Samples were introduced directly to the ESI source. The instrument settings were optimized by tuning on a Suwannee River fulvic acid standard, purchased from the International Humic Substances Society. Blanks (HPLC grade methanol) were analyzed at the beginning and end of the day to monitor potential carry over from one sample to another. The instrument was flushed between samples using a mixture of water and methanol. The ion accumulation time varied to account for differences in C concentration between samples. One hundred and forty-four individual scans were averaged for each sample and internally calibrated using an OM homologous series separated by 14 Da (CH2 groups). The mass measurement accuracy was &lt;1 ppm for singly charged ions across a broad m/z range (100–1,000 m/z). The mass resolution was ∼240 K at 341 m/z. The transient was 0.8 s. Data Analysis software (BrukerDaltonik version 4.2) was used to convert raw spectra to a list of m/z values applying FTICR–MS peak picker module with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) threshold set to 7 and absolute intensity threshold to the default value of 100. Putative chemical formulae were then assigned using Formularity software, as previously described. Chemical formulae were assigned based on the following criteria: S/N &gt; 7, mass measurement error &lt;1 ppm, and taking into consideration the presence of C, H, O, N, S, and P and excluding other elements. To ensure consistent formula assignment and eliminate mass shifts that could impact formula assignment, all sample peak lists were aligned to each other. The following rules were implemented to further ensure consistent formula assignment: (a) picking formulae with the lowest error between predicted and observed m/z, and with the lowest number of heteroatoms, and (b) the assignment of one phosphorus atom requires the presence of at least four oxygen atoms. The chemical character of thousands of peaks in each sample's ESI FTICR–MS spectrum was evaluated using van Krevelen diagrams."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":["https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Drought_induces_soil_microbial_stress_responses_and_emissions_of_volatile_organic_compounds_in_an_artificial_tropical_rainforest/20334537/2"],"contentUrl":{},"metadataVersion":[2],"schemaVersion":["http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4"],"source":["mds"],"isActive":[true],"state":["findable"],"reason":{},"viewCount":[0],"downloadCount":[0],"referenceCount":[0],"citationCount":[0],"partCount":[0],"partOfCount":[0],"versionCount":[0],"versionOfCount":[0],"created":["2023-06-13T20:33:22Z"],"registered":["2023-06-13T20:33:22Z"],"published":{},"updated":["2023-06-16T15:22:37Z"]},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":["figshare.ars"],"type":["clients"]}}}},{"id":["10.6084/m9.figshare.20334537"],"type":["dois"],"attributes":{"doi":["10.6084/m9.figshare.20334537"],"identifiers":[],"creators":[{"name":["Honeker, Linnea"],"givenName":["Linnea"],"familyName":["Honeker"],"affiliation":[],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Pugliese, Giovanni"],"givenName":["Giovanni"],"familyName":["Pugliese"],"affiliation":[],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Ingrisch, Johannes"],"givenName":["Johannes"],"familyName":["Ingrisch"],"affiliation":[],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Fudyma, Jane D."],"givenName":["Jane D."],"familyName":["Fudyma"],"affiliation":[],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["P.

The GC-PTR can speciate structural isomers and help identify some unknowns by matching to calibrated retention times. <br> <strong>NMR <\/strong> 1H-NMR bulk metabolite characterization was performed on soil water extracts. Samples (180 µL) were combined with 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane- 5-sulfonate-d6 (DSS-d6) in D2O (20 µL, 5 mM) and thoroughly mixed prior to transfer to 3 mm NMR tubes. Resonances corresponding to 13C labeling were identified by visual inspection, comparing labeled spectra to unlabeled spectra. Once differences were identified, the molecular location and quantification of 13C incorporation was determined by J-coupling pattern analysis and the ‘linefitting’ tool in Mestrenova, respectively. NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer operating at a field strength of 17.6 T (1H ν0 of 750.24 MHz) and equipped with a 5 mm Bruker TCI/CP HCN (inverse) cryoprobe with Z-gradient and at a regulated temperature of 298 K. The one-dimensional 1H spectra were acquired using a nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (noesypr1d) pulse sequence. The 90° H pulse was calibrated prior to the measurement of each sample with a spectral width of 12 ppm and 1024 transients. The NOESY mixing time was 100 ms and the acquisition time was 4 s followed by a relaxation delay of 1.5 s during which presaturation of the water signal was applied. Time domain free induction decays (72114 total points) were zero filled to 131072 total points prior to Fourier transform, followed by exponential multiplication (0.3 Hz line-broadening), and semi-automatic multipoint smooth segments baseline correction. Chemical shifts were referenced to the 11H methyl or 13C signal in DSS-d6 at 0 ppm. The 1D 11H NMR spectra of all samples were processed, assigned and analyzed using Chenomx NMR suite 9.2 (Chenomx Inc.; Edmonton, AB, Canada) with quantification of spectral intensities of compounds in the Chenomx library relative to the internal standard. Candidate metabolites present in each of the complex mixtures were determined by matching chemical shift, J-coupling and intensity information of the experimental signals against signals of the standard metabolites in the Chenomx library. Signal to noise ratios (S/N) were measured using MestReNova v 14.2.014 with the limit of quantification equal to a S/N of 10 and the limit of detection equal to a S/N of 3. Standard 2-D experiments such as 11H / 13C - heteronuclear correlation (HSQC) experiments or 2-D 11H/ 11H Total Correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) experiments further aided corroboration of several metabolite identifications where there was sufficient S/N. <strong>FTICR <\/strong> A 12 Tesla Bruker FTICR mass spectrometer (MS) was used to collect high-resolution mass spectra of WEOC by direct injection for secondary metabolite characterization. Approximately 100 µL of water extract was mixed with methanol (1:2) before injection onto the mass spectrometer to enhance ionization. A standard Bruker electrospray ionization (ESI) source was used to generate negatively charged molecular ions. Samples were introduced directly to the ESI source. The instrument settings were optimized by tuning on a Suwannee River fulvic acid standard, purchased from the International Humic Substances Society. Blanks (HPLC grade methanol) were analyzed at the beginning and end of the day to monitor potential carry over from one sample to another. The instrument was flushed between samples using a mixture of water and methanol. The ion accumulation time varied to account for differences in C concentration between samples. One hundred and forty-four individual scans were averaged for each sample and internally calibrated using an OM homologous series separated by 14 Da (CH2 groups). The mass measurement accuracy was &lt;1 ppm for singly charged ions across a broad m/z range (100–1,000 m/z). The mass resolution was ∼240 K at 341 m/z. The transient was 0.8 s. Data Analysis software (BrukerDaltonik version 4.2) was used to convert raw spectra to a list of m/z values applying FTICR–MS peak picker module with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) threshold set to 7 and absolute intensity threshold to the default value of 100. Putative chemical formulae were then assigned using Formularity software, as previously described. Chemical formulae were assigned based on the following criteria: S/N &gt; 7, mass measurement error &lt;1 ppm, and taking into consideration the presence of C, H, O, N, S, and P and excluding other elements. To ensure consistent formula assignment and eliminate mass shifts that could impact formula assignment, all sample peak lists were aligned to each other. The following rules were implemented to further ensure consistent formula assignment: (a) picking formulae with the lowest error between predicted and observed m/z, and with the lowest number of heteroatoms, and (b) the assignment of one phosphorus atom requires the presence of at least four oxygen atoms. The chemical character of thousands of peaks in each sample's ESI FTICR–MS spectrum was evaluated using van Krevelen diagrams."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":["https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Drought_induces_soil_microbial_stress_responses_and_emissions_of_volatile_organic_compounds_in_an_artificial_tropical_rainforest/20334537/3"],"contentUrl":{},"metadataVersion":[1],"schemaVersion":["http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4"],"source":["mds"],"isActive":[true],"state":["findable"],"reason":{},"viewCount":[0],"downloadCount":[0],"referenceCount":[0],"citationCount":[0],"partCount":[0],"partOfCount":[0],"versionCount":[0],"versionOfCount":[0],"created":["2023-06-16T15:22:35Z"],"registered":["2023-06-16T15:22:36Z"],"published":{},"updated":["2023-06-16T15:22:36Z"]},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":["figshare.ars"],"type":["clients"]}}}},{"id":["10.6084/m9.figshare.20334537.v1"],"type":["dois"],"attributes":{"doi":["10.6084/m9.figshare.20334537.v1"],"identifiers":[],"creators":[{"name":["Honeker, Linnea"],"givenName":["Linnea"],"familyName":["Honeker"],"affiliation":[],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Pugliese, Giovanni"],"givenName":["Giovanni"],"familyName":["Pugliese"],"affiliation":[],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Ingrisch, Johannes"],"givenName":["Johannes"],"familyName":["Ingrisch"],"affiliation":[],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Fudyma, Jane D."],"givenName":["Jane D."],"familyName":["Fudyma"],"affiliation":[],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["P.

After gas fluxes were expected to equilibrate, approximately 8 hr post pyruvate labeling (~ 6 PM), measurement intervals were decreased to low frequency (50 minutes) and remained at this frequency until measurements were stopped at 48 hr post labeling. For each measurement, the automatic chamber closed over the collar for a total of 10 min (pre-purge, 2.5 min; measurements, 6.5 min; post-purge, 1 min). Fluxes were measured using an automated, multiplexed Licor soil flux system (Licor 8100, Li-8150 16-port multiplexer and Lic 8100-104 Long-Term Chambers with opaque lids, Licor Inc.). The system was coupled to a Picarro G2201-i analyzer (Picarro Inc., Santa Clara, US) to measure CO2 and isotopic composition and a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF 8000, Ionicon Inc. Innsbruck, Austria) for VOCs (including 13C-VOCs). The PTR-ToF-MS sampled the sub-flow from the soil flux system at 30 sccm <em>via<\/em> fluorinated ethylene propylene tubing heated at 60 °C. The drift voltage was 600 V, the drift temperature was 60°C and the drift pressure was 2.2 mbar, resulting in an E/N ratio of 137 Td. The time resolution was 10 ms and the mass range was up to 500 amu. The PTR-ToF was operated in the H3O+ mode, therefore only compounds having proton affinity higher than water (697 kJ/mol) underwent proton-transfer reactions and could be detected on their protonated mass to charge ratio (<em>m/z<\/em>), which includes the vast majority of VOCs . Measured ions were attributed to chemical formulas and specific chemical species based on the exact protonated <em>m/z<\/em>. PTR-TOF data were processed using the software PTRwid. To account for possible variations of the reagent ion signals, measured ion intensities were normalized to the H3O+ counts in combination with the water-cluster ion counts. At midnight, automatic calibrations were performed using standard gas cylinders containing different multi-VOC component calibration mixtures in Ultra-High Purity (UHP) nitrogen (Apel-Riemer Environmental, Inc., Colorado, USA). For a detailed description of the calibration setup see Werner et al. (2021). The concentrations of compounds included in the standard were calculated with an uncertainty of ≤23%. Concentrations of compounds not included in the calibration standard cylinders were calculated by applying the kinetic theory of proton transfer reaction with an uncertainty of ≤50%. Select additional soil experiments were conducted with a Vocus proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF; TOFWERK, AG, Thun, Switzerland) coupled to a custom-built gas chromatograph (GC; Aerodyne Research, Inc., Billerica, MA, USA). The GC contains an integrated two-stage adsorbent-based thermal desorption preconcentration system for <em> in situ<\/em> collection of VOCs prior to separation on the chromatographic column. For preconcentration, a multi-bed (Tenax TA/Graphitized Carbon/Carboxen 1000; Markes International) sorbent tube was used for the first stage of sample collection, this tube is then subjected to a post-collection water purge before the sample was thermally desorbed to a multi-bed focusing trap (Tenax, Carbopack X, Carboxen 1003; Markes International) prior to injection onto the GC column. For this study, the GC was equipped with a 30-m Rxi-624 column (Restek, 0.25 mm ID, 1.4 µm film thickness) which resolves non- to mid-polarity VOCs in the C5 - C12 volatility range prior to ionization in the PTR detector.

(IHC) was visualized by using an automatic multispectral imaging system with associated software (Vectra II, PerkinElmer, version 2.0.7.1).

The absorbance was measured by automatic microplate reader with associated software (Tecan Infinite M200, version 1.6.19.2). The interaction between each sub-component in HLPC were measured by microscale thermophoresis (MST, NT.115, Nanotemper, Germany). Flow cytometry data was acquired with Backman CytoFLEX LX Flow Cytometer with associated software (version 2.3.1.22). The biodistribution of nanoparticles were observed by using IVIS imaging system (PerkinElmer, USA, version 4.5.5). Power analysis of the animal experiments indicated that the chosen sample sizes per group are sufficient. We also referred to relevant literature to determine sample sizes. For the in vitro and in vivo experiments, we followed standards of good scientific practice. We used at least 3 biological replicates or 3 animals per group, to calculate means and standard deviations and to perform statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0. Data were analyzed by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-tests (two groups) or One-way ANOVA (multiple-groups).

(IHC) was visualized by using an automatic multispectral imaging system with associated software (Vectra II, PerkinElmer, version 2.0.7.1). The size and zeta potential of HLPC and M@HLPC were measured by using a nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA, Particle Metrix, Germany, version 8.05.04). The absorbance was measured by automatic microplate reader with associated software (Tecan Infinite M200, version 1.6.19.2). The interaction between each sub-component in HLPC were measured by microscale thermophoresis (MST, NT.115, Nanotemper, Germany). Flow cytometry data was acquired with Backman CytoFLEX LX Flow Cytometer with associated software (version 2.3.1.22). The biodistribution of nanoparticles were observed by using IVIS imaging system (PerkinElmer, USA, version 4.5.5). Power analysis of the animal experiments indicated that the chosen sample sizes per group are sufficient. We also referred to relevant literature to determine sample sizes. For the in vitro and in vivo experiments, we followed standards of good scientific practice. We used at least 3 biological replicates or 3 animals per group, to calculate means and standard deviations and to perform statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0. Data were analyzed by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-tests (two groups) or One-way ANOVA (multiple-groups).

baumannii <\/em>is an infectious agent of global proportion and concern, partly due to its proficiency in development of antibiotic resistance phenotypes and biofilm formation. Dithiocarbamates (DTC) have been identified as possible alternatives to the current antimicrobials. We report here the evaluation of several DTC-metal complexes against <em>A. baumannii<\/em> planktonic cells and biofilms. Among the DTC-metal complexes and DTCs tested, ZnL1 (N-methyl-1-phenyldithiocarbamato-S,S’ Zn(II)), originally designed as an antitumor agent, is effective against biofilm forming <em>A. baumannii.<\/em> A MIC value of 12.5 µM, comparable to that of Gentamicin (5 µM) was measured for planktonic cells in tryptic soy broth. Spectroscopy, microscopy and biochemical analyses reveal cell membrane degradation and leakage after treatment with ZnL1. Bioelectrochemical analysis show that ZnL1 reduces biofilm formation and decreases extracellular respiration of pre-formed biofilms, as corroborated by microscopic analyses. Due to the affinity of Zn to cells and the metal chelating nature of L1 ligand, we hypothesize ZnL1 could alter metalloprotein functions in the membranes of <em>A. baumannii<\/em> cells, leading to altered redox balance and cell. Results indicate that DTC-Zn metal complex are effective antimicrobial agents against early <em>A. baumannii biofilms<\/em> under laboratory conditions."],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":["https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Assessment_of_physiological_and_electrochemical_effects_of_a_repurposed_Zinc_dithiocarbamate_complex_on_Acinetobacter_baumannii_biofilms/19747621/1"],"contentUrl":{},"metadataVersion":[1],"schemaVersion":["http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4"],"source":["mds"],"isActive":[true],"state":["findable"],"reason":{},"viewCount":[0],"downloadCount":[0],"referenceCount":[0],"citationCount":[0],"partCount":[0],"partOfCount":[0],"versionCount":[0],"versionOfCount":[0],"created":["2022-05-11T17:25:52Z"],"registered":["2022-05-11T17:25:53Z"],"published":{},"updated":["2022-05-11T17:25:53Z"]},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":["figshare.ars"],"type":["clients"]}}}},{"id":["10.3886/icpsr36585"],"type":["dois"],"attributes":{"doi":["10.3886/icpsr36585"],"identifiers":[{"identifier":["36585"],"identifierType":["ICPSR Study Number"]}],"creators":[{"name":["Herrick, Rebekah"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Rebekah"],"familyName":["Herrick"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]}],"titles":[{"lang":["en"],"title":["Survey of State Legislators Relationship with their Districts, 2008"]},{"lang":["en"],"title":["Archival Version"],"titleType":["Subtitle"]}],"publisher":["ICPSR - Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research"],"container":{},"publicationYear":[2016],"subjects":[{"lang":["en"],"subject":["communications systems"],"subjectScheme":["ICPSR"]},{"lang":["en"],"subject":["constituent relations"],"subjectScheme":["ICPSR"]},{"lang":["en"],"subject":["government"],"subjectScheme":["ICPSR"]},{"lang":["en"],"subject":["legislators"],"subjectScheme":["ICPSR"]},{"lang":["en"],"subject":["same-sex marriage"],"subjectScheme":["ICPSR"]},{"lang":["en"],"subject":["social media"],"subjectScheme":["ICPSR"]},{"lang":["en"],"subject":["state government"],"subjectScheme":["ICPSR"]},{"lang":["en"],"subject":["state legislators"],"subjectScheme":["ICPSR"]},{"lang":["en"],"subject":["time utilization"],"subjectScheme":["ICPSR"]}],"contributors":[],"dates":[{"date":["2008-01-01"],"dateType":["Collected"]},{"date":["2008-11-01/2008-12-31"],"dateType":["Collected"]},{"date":["2016"],"dateType":["Issued"]}],"language":["en"],"types":{"ris":["DATA"],"bibtex":["misc"],"citeproc":["dataset"],"schemaOrg":["Dataset"],"resourceType":["survey data"],"resourceTypeGeneral":["Dataset"]},"relatedIdentifiers":[],"relatedItems":[],"sizes":[],"formats":[],"version":["v0"],"rightsList":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":["en"],"description":["The Survey of State Legislators Relationship with their Districts, 2008 collection represents data from state legislators within states that passed an initiative or referendum on same-sex marriage and who responded to a fall 2008 mail survey.

(IHC) was visualized by using an automatic multispectral imaging system with associated software (Vectra II, PerkinElmer, version 2.0.7.1). The size and zeta potential of HLPC and M@HLPC were measured by using a nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA, Particle Metrix, Germany, version 8.05.04). The absorbance was measured by automatic microplate reader with associated software (Tecan Infinite M200, version 1.6.19.2). The interaction between each sub-component in HLPC were measured by microscale thermophoresis (MST, NT.115, Nanotemper, Germany). Flow cytometry data was acquired with Backman CytoFLEX LX Flow Cytometer with associated software (version 2.3.1.22). The biodistribution of nanoparticles were observed by using IVIS imaging system (PerkinElmer, USA, version 4.5.5).Power analysis of the animal experiments indicated that the chosen sample sizes per group are sufficient. We also referred to relevant literature to determine sample sizes. For the in vitro and in vivo experiments, we followed standards of good scientific practice.

Each belt transect was adjacent to a randomly selected crop tramline and were distributed across the entire field and ran its length. The areas searched were 4 m<sup>2<\/sup> quadrats at least 10 m apart and all observed linyphiids and lycosids were collected. Spiders were taken from 64 randomly selected locations along the aforementioned transects. Following collection of spiders, 4 m<sup>2<\/sup> of ground and crop stems was suction sampled for approximately 30 seconds, with the collected material emptied into a bag and any organisms immediately killed with ethyl-acetate. Suction sampling used a ‘G-vac’ modified garden leaf-blower. All material was later frozen at -20 ºC for storage before sorting in the lab. These invertebrates were collected for background population densities and not for any molecular work. All invertebrates were identified to family level. Further identifications were not carried out due to the inability to identify some of the invertebrate groups further via the associated metabarcoding-derived dietary data (e.g., Sciaridae), and the difficulty associated with finer taxonomic resolution of many damaged or immature specimens. The only taxa not identified to family level were springtails of the superfamily Sminthuroidea (Sminthuridae and Bourletiellidae, which were often indistinguishable following suction sampling and preservation due to the fine features necessary to differentiate them) which were left at super-family, mites (many of which were immature or in poor condition, or lacked appropriate taxonomic keys) which were identified to order level and wasps of the superfamily Ichneumonoidea (which were identified no further due to obscurity of wing venation due to damage); in these cases, these taxonomic assignments were pooled to family-level for later analyses. <strong>Extraction and high-throughput sequencing of spider gut content DNA<\/strong> Given their prevalence in field collections, dietary analysis was carried out for the linyphiid spider genera <em>Erigone<\/em>, <em>Tenuiphantes<\/em>, <em>Bathyphantes<\/em> and <em>Microlinyphia <\/em>(Araneae: Linyphiidae), and <em>Pardosa <\/em>(Araneae: Lycosidae). Spiders were transferred to and washed in fresh 100% ethanol to reduce external contaminants prior to identification via morphological keys(<em>1<\/em>). Abdomens were removed from spiders and again transferred to and washed in fresh 100% ethanol. DNA was extracted from the abdomens via Qiagen TissueLyser II and DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer protocol, but with an extended lysis time of 12 hours to account for the complex and branched gut system in spider abdomens(<em>2<\/em>). For amplification of DNA, two primer pairs were used. BerenF-LuthienR(<em>3<\/em>) amplified a broad range of invertebrates including spiders, and TelperionF-LaureR, amplified a range of invertebrates with the exception of some spiders (modified from TelperionF-LaurelinR(<em>3<\/em>) (via one base-pair change to decrease host DNA amplification; 5’-ggrtawacwgttcawccagt-3’). These two primer pairs amplified 314 bp (BerenF-LuthienR) and 302 bp (TelperionF-LaureR) regions of COI. Primers were labelled with unique 10 bp molecular identifier tags (MID-tags) so that each individual had a unique pairing of forward and reverse for identification of each spider post-sequencing. PCR reactions of 25 µl volumes contained 12.5 µl Qiagen PCR Multiplex kit, 0.2 µmol (2.5 µl of 2 µM) of each primer and 5 µl template DNA. Reactions were carried out in the same thermocycler, optimized via temperature gradient, with an initial 15 minutes at 95 °C, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 seconds, the primer-specific annealing temperature for 90 seconds and 72 °C for 90 seconds, respectively, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 minutes. BerenF-LuthienR and TelperionF-LaureR used annealing temperatures of 52 °C and 42 °C, respectively. Within each PCR 96-well plate, 12 negative controls (extraction and PCR), 2 blank controls and 2 positive controls were included (i.e. 80 samples per plate), based on Taberlet et al.(<em>4<\/em>). Positive controls were mixtures of invertebrate DNA comprised of non-native Asiatic species in four different proportions (Table S1) and blanks were empty wells within each plate to identify tag-jumping into unused MID-tag combinations. PCR negative controls were DNase-free water treated identically to DNA samples. A negative control was present for each MID-tag to identify any contamination of primers. All PCR products were visualized in a 2 % agarose gel with SYBR®Safe (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Paisley, UK) and placed in categories based on their relative brightness. The concentration of these brightness categories was quantified via Qubit dsDNA High-sensitivity Assay Kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with at least three representatives of each category per plate. The PCR products were then proportionally pooled according to these concentrations. Each pool was cleaned via SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, USA), with a left-side size selection using a 1:1 ratio (retaining ~300-1000 bp fragments). The concentration of the pooled DNA was then determined via Qubit dsDNA High-sensitivity Assay Kits and pooled together into one library per primer pair. Library preparation for Illumina sequencing was carried out on the cleaned libraries via NEXTflex Rapid DNA-Seq Kit (Bioo Scientific, Austin, USA) and samples were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq via a V3 chip with 300-bp paired-end reads (expected capacity ≤25,000,000 reads). <strong>Bioinformatic analysis<\/strong> The Illumina run generated 11,165,405 and 10,959,010 reads for BerenF-LuthienR and TelperionF-LaureR, respectively, which were quality-checked and paired via FastP(<em>5<\/em>) to retain only sequences of at least 200 bp with a quality threshold of 33, resulting in 10,561,874 and 9,355,112 paired reads. The paired reads were demultiplexed and assigned to their respective spider sample according to their MID-tags via the “trim.seqs” command in Mothur v1.39.5(<em>6<\/em>), leaving 7,854,610 and 7,437,929 reads with exact matches to the primer and MID-tags. Replicates were removed, and denoising and clustering to amplicon sequence variants (ASVs; clustered without % identity to avoid multiple species represented within a single operational taxonomic unit (OTU)) completed via Unoise3 in Usearch11(<em>7<\/em>). The resultant sequences were assigned a taxonomic identity from GenBank via BLASTn v2.7.1(<em>8<\/em>) using a 97% identity threshold(<em>9<\/em>). The BLAST output was analyzed in MEGAN v6.15.2(<em>10<\/em>). Where the top BLAST hit, determined by lowest e-value, was resolved at a higher taxonomic level than species-level, the results were checked; where possibly erroneous entries were preventing species-level assignment (e.g., poorly resolved identifications on GenBank), finer resolution was assigned based on the next-closest match. Where ASVs were assigned the same taxon, these were aggregated. Data clean-up followed the protocol described as optimal by Drake <em>et al<\/em>.(<em>11<\/em>). The maximum value for an ASV present in blank or negative controls was identified and subtracted from all read counts for that ASV to remove background contaminants. Simultaneously, known lab contaminants (e.g., German cockroach <em>Blattella germanica<\/em>), artefacts and errors of the sequencing process, unexpected reads in positive controls and positive control taxon reads in dietary samples were identified. These were calculated as a percentage of their respective sample’s read count and any read counts lower than the highest of these percentages for their respective sample were removed to eliminate additional instances of contamination. These thresholds were defined as 0.38% and 0.39% for BerenF-LuthienR and TelperionF-LaureR, respectively. The data from the two libraries (i.e., from each primer pair) were then aggregated together by sample and aggregated again by taxon. Non-target taxa (e.g., fungi) and instances in which predator DNA was amplified (i.e. ASVs with high read counts matching the individual’s morphological identity) were removed. All remaining read counts were converted to presence-absence. <strong>Macronutrient determination<\/strong> Specimens were taken for macronutrient analysis from the same suction samples collected for invertebrate community identification. Representatives were taken from each family found in the community samples for which specimens were intact, in visually good condition and relatively clean of soil and other contaminants. If specimens were from a relatively uncommon family but unclean, soil and other surface contaminants were physically removed, and the specimen then momentarily dipped in water to remove remaining surface contaminants without greatly dislodging surface lipids. Macronutrient contents were determined following the MEDI protocol(<em>12<\/em>, <em>13<\/em>) with minor alterations to account for the small size of most of the invertebrates processed(<em>14<\/em>). During extraction, half volumes (i.e. 500 µl) of solvents were used. For the lipid assays, 15 µl of sulfuric acid was added for a 15 min incubation, followed by only 200 µl of vanillin reagent to increase the concentration and development of analyte for more accurate readings from smaller invertebrates. Lipid and protein standard series were diluted to 50% of the concentration specified in the original protocol (i.e. 0-1 mg ml<sup>-1<\/sup>). Carbohydrate assays used 140 µl of reagent with 30 min incubation at 92 °C followed by a further 30 min at room temperature. Carbohydrate standard series were diluted to 1% of the concentrations specified in the original protocol (i.e. 0-0.02 mg ml<sup>-1<\/sup>) to ensure signals overcame the higher limit of detection relative to typical invertebrate carbohydrate content. <strong>Statistical analysis<\/strong> All analyses were conducted in R v.4.0.3(<em>15<\/em>). <em>In situ<\/em> spider prey choice was analyzed using network-based null models in econullnetr(<em>16<\/em>) with the ‘generate_null_net’ command. A bespoke set of functions was used alongside econullnetr to randomly generate an “expected diet” for each individual spider based on local prey communities determined via suction sampling. Macronutrient data were allocated to each dietary taxon and the mean macronutrient proportions calculated. The mean macronutrient contents were compared between expected and observed diets using a multivariate linear model (MLM) via mvabund(<em>17<\/em>) and significant differences visually represented through ternary plots using ggtern(<em>18<\/em>) and ggplot2(<em>19<\/em>). The observed mean nutrient proportions of spider diets were compared between spider genera, life stages and sexes using a MLM. To ascertain how prey choice factors into these dietary differences, the difference in macronutrient proportions between expected and observed spider diets were also compared between spider genera, life stages and sexes in a MLM. To group taxa into tropho-species, mean macronutrient values for each taxon were first determined to prevent splitting of taxa across clusters; these were represented at the family, order and class levels to allow tropho-species assignment for families for which macronutrient content was not determined, but was at a higher level. Macronutrient values were scaled by subtracting the mean of each column from each contained value and dividing it by the column standard deviation using the ‘scale’ function. A Euclidean distance matrix was calculated using the ‘dist’ function. Hierarchical clustering of scaled macronutrient distance matrix used the ‘hclust’ function. Optimal clustering solutions were determined by comparison of Dunn’s index between methods and <em>k<\/em> values; this was calculated using the ‘dunn’ function in the “clValid” package(<em>20<\/em>) for each cluster <em>k<\/em> value above five until the Dunn index decreased, the first instance of the value preceding the decrease deemed the maximum value, thus optimal solution. Clustering solutions based on ‘average’, ‘complete’, ‘single’, ‘median’, ‘centroid’ and ‘mcquitty’ linkages were compared, and the “complete” method selected for subsequent analysis as it resulted in the smallest number of clusters (20; thus, the most efficient simplification of the taxa analyzed). Three uncommon families (present in small numbers in one community sample each, but no dietary detections) were removed from further tropho-species analyses due to the lack of class-level macronutrient data (Arionidae, Lithobiidae and Polydesmidae). To name the tropho-species, a second clustering stage was used in which the tropho-species were grouped according to their mean macronutrient content for each of the three nutrients separately. ‘Single’ linkage clustering was found to be the optimal method for this step and created ten, seven and six groups for carbohydrate, lipid and protein, respectively. These clusters were labelled from one to the total number of clusters for each macronutrient to represent low-to-high content of that nutrient relative to other tropho-species. Names used the structure ‘C<em>x<\/em>L<em>y<\/em>P<em>z<\/em>’ to denote the relative content of each tropho-species (<em>x<\/em>, <em>y<\/em> and <em>z<\/em> replaced with the cluster number for carbohydrate, lipid and protein, respectively). Clusters were henceforth termed ‘tropho-species’, with all taxa within a single cluster representing a single aggregated tropho-species. Heatmap dendrograms were produced using the ‘heatmap.2’ function in the ‘gplots’ package(<em>21<\/em>), with cluster colors assigned with the ‘Accent’ palette of ‘RColorBrewer’(<em>22<\/em>) and relative macronutrient content color scaling produced using the ‘viridis’ package(<em>23<\/em>). Ternary plots were produced to visualize the macronutrient content of taxa within each cluster, and differences in mean macronutrient contents between tropho-species. Tropho-species were assigned to each taxon present in dietary and prey community samples. Where family-level macronutrient data were not obtained (usually low abundance and poor condition invertebrates or families identified in the diet that were not subsequently observed in community samples), order-level tropho-species assignment was used, or class where order-level data were not available (12 and 2 instances of uncommon taxa, respectively). <em>In situ<\/em> spider prey choice with respect to tropho-species was analyzed using network-based null models in econullnetr(<em>16<\/em>) with the ‘generate_null_net’ command, visually represented with the ‘plot_preferences’ command. Standardized effect sizes of prey choice for each combination of spider genus, sex and life stage, indicative of the extent of deviation from random, were extracted from the null models and compared between genera, sexes and life stages using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PerMANOVA) via the ‘adonis’ function in vegan(<em>24<\/em>). To determine any tropho-species-specific differences, these data were further analyzed via similarity percentages analysis (SIMPER), also in vegan. 1. M. J.

BerenF-LuthienR(<em>3<\/em>) amplified a broad range of invertebrates including spiders, and TelperionF-LaureR, amplified a range of invertebrates with the exception of some spiders (modified from TelperionF-LaurelinR(<em>3<\/em>) (via one base-pair change to decrease host DNA amplification; 5’-ggrtawacwgttcawccagt-3’). These two primer pairs amplified 314 bp (BerenF-LuthienR) and 302 bp (TelperionF-LaureR) regions of COI. Primers were labelled with unique 10 bp molecular identifier tags (MID-tags) so that each individual had a unique pairing of forward and reverse for identification of each spider post-sequencing. PCR reactions of 25 µl volumes contained 12.5 µl Qiagen PCR Multiplex kit, 0.2 µmol (2.5 µl of 2 µM) of each primer and 5 µl template DNA. Reactions were carried out in the same thermocycler, optimized via temperature gradient, with an initial 15 minutes at 95 °C, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 seconds, the primer-specific annealing temperature for 90 seconds and 72 °C for 90 seconds, respectively, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 minutes. BerenF-LuthienR and TelperionF-LaureR used annealing temperatures of 52 °C and 42 °C, respectively. Within each PCR 96-well plate, 12 negative controls (extraction and PCR), 2 blank controls and 2 positive controls were included (i.e. 80 samples per plate), based on Taberlet et al.(<em>4<\/em>). Positive controls were mixtures of invertebrate DNA comprised of non-native Asiatic species in four different proportions (Table S1) and blanks were empty wells within each plate to identify tag-jumping into unused MID-tag combinations. PCR negative controls were DNase-free water treated identically to DNA samples. A negative control was present for each MID-tag to identify any contamination of primers. All PCR products were visualized in a 2 % agarose gel with SYBR®Safe (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Paisley, UK) and placed in categories based on their relative brightness. The concentration of these brightness categories was quantified via Qubit dsDNA High-sensitivity Assay Kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with at least three representatives of each category per plate. The PCR products were then proportionally pooled according to these concentrations. Each pool was cleaned via SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, USA), with a left-side size selection using a 1:1 ratio (retaining ~300-1000 bp fragments). The concentration of the pooled DNA was then determined via Qubit dsDNA High-sensitivity Assay Kits and pooled together into one library per primer pair. Library preparation for Illumina sequencing was carried out on the cleaned libraries via NEXTflex Rapid DNA-Seq Kit (Bioo Scientific, Austin, USA) and samples were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq via a V3 chip with 300-bp paired-end reads (expected capacity ≤25,000,000 reads). <strong>Bioinformatic analysis<\/strong> The Illumina run generated 11,165,405 and 10,959,010 reads for BerenF-LuthienR and TelperionF-LaureR, respectively, which were quality-checked and paired via FastP(<em>5<\/em>) to retain only sequences of at least 200 bp with a quality threshold of 33, resulting in 10,561,874 and 9,355,112 paired reads. The paired reads were demultiplexed and assigned to their respective spider sample according to their MID-tags via the “trim.seqs” command in Mothur v1.39.5(<em>6<\/em>), leaving 7,854,610 and 7,437,929 reads with exact matches to the primer and MID-tags. Replicates were removed, and denoising and clustering to amplicon sequence variants (ASVs; clustered without % identity to avoid multiple species represented within a single operational taxonomic unit (OTU)) completed via Unoise3 in Usearch11(<em>7<\/em>). The resultant sequences were assigned a taxonomic identity from GenBank via BLASTn v2.7.1(<em>8<\/em>) using a 97% identity threshold(<em>9<\/em>). The BLAST output was analyzed in MEGAN v6.15.2(<em>10<\/em>). Where the top BLAST hit, determined by lowest e-value, was resolved at a higher taxonomic level than species-level, the results were checked; where possibly erroneous entries were preventing species-level assignment (e.g., poorly resolved identifications on GenBank), finer resolution was assigned based on the next-closest match. Where ASVs were assigned the same taxon, these were aggregated. Data clean-up followed the protocol described as optimal by Drake <em>et al<\/em>.(<em>11<\/em>). The maximum value for an ASV present in blank or negative controls was identified and subtracted from all read counts for that ASV to remove background contaminants. Simultaneously, known lab contaminants (e.g., German cockroach <em>Blattella germanica<\/em>), artefacts and errors of the sequencing process, unexpected reads in positive controls and positive control taxon reads in dietary samples were identified. These were calculated as a percentage of their respective sample’s read count and any read counts lower than the highest of these percentages for their respective sample were removed to eliminate additional instances of contamination. These thresholds were defined as 0.38% and 0.39% for BerenF-LuthienR and TelperionF-LaureR, respectively. The data from the two libraries (i.e., from each primer pair) were then aggregated together by sample and aggregated again by taxon. Non-target taxa (e.g., fungi) and instances in which predator DNA was amplified (i.e. ASVs with high read counts matching the individual’s morphological identity) were removed. All remaining read counts were converted to presence-absence. <strong>Macronutrient determination<\/strong> Specimens were taken for macronutrient analysis from the same suction samples collected for invertebrate community identification. Representatives were taken from each family found in the community samples for which specimens were intact, in visually good condition and relatively clean of soil and other contaminants. If specimens were from a relatively uncommon family but unclean, soil and other surface contaminants were physically removed, and the specimen then momentarily dipped in water to remove remaining surface contaminants without greatly dislodging surface lipids. Macronutrient contents were determined following the MEDI protocol(<em>12<\/em>, <em>13<\/em>) with minor alterations to account for the small size of most of the invertebrates processed(<em>14<\/em>). During extraction, half volumes (i.e. 500 µl) of solvents were used. For the lipid assays, 15 µl of sulfuric acid was added for a 15 min incubation, followed by only 200 µl of vanillin reagent to increase the concentration and development of analyte for more accurate readings from smaller invertebrates. Lipid and protein standard series were diluted to 50% of the concentration specified in the original protocol (i.e. 0-1 mg ml<sup>-1<\/sup>). Carbohydrate assays used 140 µl of reagent with 30 min incubation at 92 °C followed by a further 30 min at room temperature. Carbohydrate standard series were diluted to 1% of the concentrations specified in the original protocol (i.e. 0-0.02 mg ml<sup>-1<\/sup>) to ensure signals overcame the higher limit of detection relative to typical invertebrate carbohydrate content. <strong>Statistical analysis<\/strong> All analyses were conducted in R v.4.0.3(<em>15<\/em>). <em>In situ<\/em> spider prey choice was analyzed using network-based null models in econullnetr(<em>16<\/em>) with the ‘generate_null_net’ command. A bespoke set of functions was used alongside econullnetr to randomly generate an “expected diet” for each individual spider based on local prey communities determined via suction sampling. Macronutrient data were allocated to each dietary taxon and the mean macronutrient proportions calculated. The mean macronutrient contents were compared between expected and observed diets using a multivariate linear model (MLM) via mvabund(<em>17<\/em>) and significant differences visually represented through ternary plots using ggtern(<em>18<\/em>) and ggplot2(<em>19<\/em>). The observed mean nutrient proportions of spider diets were compared between spider genera, life stages and sexes using a MLM. To ascertain how prey choice factors into these dietary differences, the difference in macronutrient proportions between expected and observed spider diets were also compared between spider genera, life stages and sexes in a MLM. To group taxa into tropho-species, mean macronutrient values for each taxon were first determined to prevent splitting of taxa across clusters; these were represented at the family, order and class levels to allow tropho-species assignment for families for which macronutrient content was not determined, but was at a higher level. Macronutrient values were scaled by subtracting the mean of each column from each contained value and dividing it by the column standard deviation using the ‘scale’ function. A Euclidean distance matrix was calculated using the ‘dist’ function. Hierarchical clustering of scaled macronutrient distance matrix used the ‘hclust’ function. Optimal clustering solutions were determined by comparison of Dunn’s index between methods and <em>k<\/em> values; this was calculated using the ‘dunn’ function in the “clValid” package(<em>20<\/em>) for each cluster <em>k<\/em> value above five until the Dunn index decreased, the first instance of the value preceding the decrease deemed the maximum value, thus optimal solution. Clustering solutions based on ‘average’, ‘complete’, ‘single’, ‘median’, ‘centroid’ and ‘mcquitty’ linkages were compared, and the “complete” method selected for subsequent analysis as it resulted in the smallest number of clusters (20; thus, the most efficient simplification of the taxa analyzed). Three uncommon families (present in small numbers in one community sample each, but no dietary detections) were removed from further tropho-species analyses due to the lack of class-level macronutrient data (Arionidae, Lithobiidae and Polydesmidae). To name the tropho-species, a second clustering stage was used in which the tropho-species were grouped according to their mean macronutrient content for each of the three nutrients separately. ‘Single’ linkage clustering was found to be the optimal method for this step and created ten, seven and six groups for carbohydrate, lipid and protein, respectively. These clusters were labelled from one to the total number of clusters for each macronutrient to represent low-to-high content of that nutrient relative to other tropho-species. Names used the structure ‘C<em>x<\/em>L<em>y<\/em>P<em>z<\/em>’ to denote the relative content of each tropho-species (<em>x<\/em>, <em>y<\/em> and <em>z<\/em> replaced with the cluster number for carbohydrate, lipid and protein, respectively). Clusters were henceforth termed ‘tropho-species’, with all taxa within a single cluster representing a single aggregated tropho-species. Heatmap dendrograms were produced using the ‘heatmap.2’ function in the ‘gplots’ package(<em>21<\/em>), with cluster colors assigned with the ‘Accent’ palette of ‘RColorBrewer’(<em>22<\/em>) and relative macronutrient content color scaling produced using the ‘viridis’ package(<em>23<\/em>). Ternary plots were produced to visualize the macronutrient content of taxa within each cluster, and differences in mean macronutrient contents between tropho-species. Tropho-species were assigned to each taxon present in dietary and prey community samples. Where family-level macronutrient data were not obtained (usually low abundance and poor condition invertebrates or families identified in the diet that were not subsequently observed in community samples), order-level tropho-species assignment was used, or class where order-level data were not available (12 and 2 instances of uncommon taxa, respectively). <em>In situ<\/em> spider prey choice with respect to tropho-species was analyzed using network-based null models in econullnetr(<em>16<\/em>) with the ‘generate_null_net’ command, visually represented with the ‘plot_preferences’ command. Standardized effect sizes of prey choice for each combination of spider genus, sex and life stage, indicative of the extent of deviation from random, were extracted from the null models and compared between genera, sexes and life stages using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PerMANOVA) via the ‘adonis’ function in vegan(<em>24<\/em>). To determine any tropho-species-specific differences, these data were further analyzed via similarity percentages analysis (SIMPER), also in vegan. 1. M. J.

Abstract of the final report is stated below for reference: \"Various environmental and mechanical stressors cause deterioration of concrete bridge decks. Normal wear and tear, freeze and thaw cycles, and chloride penetration due to deicing salts can cause aggressive deterioration that usually require frequent interventions during the life-cycle of the bridge. These interventions include deck maintenance and repairs (e.g., application of sealers or overlay placement) as well as bridge deck replacement. The quantification of the life-cycle cost of bridge decks considering maintenance and repair activities represents a significant challenge facing local and state transportation agencies. The life-cycle maintenance activities not only increase the direct life-cycle cost of the bridge, but they also lead to significant indirect user costs due to increasing traffic delays, work zone crashes, and operating cost.

Normal wear and tear, freeze and thaw cycles, and chloride penetration due to deicing salts can cause aggressive deterioration that usually require frequent interventions during the life-cycle of the bridge.

The quantification of the life-cycle cost of bridge decks considering maintenance and repair activities represents a significant challenge facing local and state transportation agencies. The life-cycle maintenance activities not only increase the direct life-cycle cost of the bridge, but they also lead to significant indirect user costs due to increasing traffic delays, work zone crashes, and operating cost. Moreover, these traffic delays increase the carbon footprint of the bridge and adversely affect the life-cycle bridge sustainability.

The focus of this research is to study models and algorithms in order to aid online freight marketplaces to identify efficient consolidation strategies. To accomplish this aim, a new mixed integer programming model for the pickup and delivery problem has been developed. The model is geared towards identifying effective freight consolidation opportunities. A branch-and-cut algorithm to solve the model was also developed. The model was applied to several case studies using Transplace, Inc. (a third party logistics company) route data to identify optimized, consolidated routes. Emission impacts were also estimated for both the existing and consolidated routes using monetary equivalent cost (MEC) values. A linear regression model was developed to predict freight movement between metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). Results of the case studies were then applied to estimate the operation and environment-related costs associated with freight movement from New Orleans MSA to Oklahoma City MSA for all commodities. Finally, the results of the case studies were applied at the national level and projected for future years, to estimate the potential cost savings in freight consolidation. Results indicate that it may be possible to consolidate cargo with only 67% of the currently used number of trucks, which may reduce the operation cost by 23% and MEC by 17%.\""],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["Tran-SET Project No. 17ITSOKS02"],"descriptionType":["Other"]}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":["https://zenodo.org/record/3403285"],"contentUrl":{},"metadataVersion":[0],"schemaVersion":{},"source":["mds"],"isActive":[true],"state":["findable"],"reason":{},"viewCount":[0],"downloadCount":[0],"referenceCount":[0],"citationCount":[0],"partCount":[0],"partOfCount":[0],"versionCount":[0],"versionOfCount":[0],"created":["2019-09-09T19:13:16Z"],"registered":["2019-09-09T19:13:16Z"],"published":{},"updated":["2020-07-30T00:11:21Z"]},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":["cern.zenodo"],"type":["clients"]}}}},{"id":["10.5281/zenodo.3380550"],"type":["dois"],"attributes":{"doi":["10.5281/zenodo.3380550"],"identifiers":[],"creators":[{"name":["Soliman, Mohamed"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Mohamed"],"familyName":["Soliman"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[{"schemeUri":["https://orcid.org"],"nameIdentifier":["https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3160-0933"],"nameIdentifierScheme":["ORCID"]}]}],"titles":[{"title":["Sustainability-Based Long-Term Management of Bridges under Multi-Hazard Exposure"]}],"publisher":["Zenodo"],"container":{"type":["DataRepository"],"identifier":["http://transet.lsu.edu/completed-research/"],"identifierType":["URL"]},"publicationYear":[2018],"subjects":[{"subject":["Multi-Hazard, Risk, Climate Change, Corrosion, Scour"]}],"contributors":[],"dates":[{"date":["2018-12-01"],"dateType":["Issued"]}],"language":{},"types":{"ris":["DATA"],"bibtex":["misc"],"citeproc":["dataset"],"schemaOrg":["Dataset"],"resourceTypeGeneral":["Dataset"]},"relatedIdentifiers":[{"relationType":["IsIdenticalTo"],"relatedIdentifier":["https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/transet_data/14/"],"relatedIdentifierType":["URL"]},{"relationType":["IsPartOf"],"relatedIdentifier":["http://transet.lsu.edu/completed-research/"],"relatedIdentifierType":["URL"]},{"relationType":["IsVersionOf"],"relatedIdentifier":["10.5281/zenodo.2230567"],"relatedIdentifierType":["DOI"]}],"relatedItems":[],"sizes":[],"formats":[],"version":{},"rightsList":[{"rights":["Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International"],"rightsUri":["https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode"],"schemeUri":["https://spdx.org/licenses/"],"rightsIdentifier":["cc-by-4.0"],"rightsIdentifierScheme":["SPDX"]},{"rights":["Open Access"],"rightsUri":["info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess"]}],"descriptions":[{"description":["Corresponding data set for Tran-SET Project No. 17STOKS01. Abstract of the final report is stated below for reference: \"Bridges are under deterioration due to various mechanical and environmental stressors. Hydraulic-related hazards (e.g., flood and scour), aggressive environmental conditions, and seismic events (e.g., earthquake) are recognized as the most significant threats to the safety of bridges. In traditional risk assessment methods for structures susceptible to damage due to floods and other natural hazards (e.g., corrosion and seismic events), future hazard predictions are conducted using historic return periods and climate records. However, recent increase in flood intensity in central-southern states indicate that future hazard occurrence rate may not necessarily follow past trends. Accordingly, current design, assessment, and management methodologies should adapt to these changes in order to ensure the satisfactory performance of bridges under the combined or cumulative action of hazards. This project addresses this need by presenting a framework for risk quantification and optimum management of bridges susceptible to damage due to floods, flood induced scour, and other gradual deterioration mechanism (e.g., corrosion and fatigue).

Hydraulic-related hazards (e.g., flood and scour), aggressive environmental conditions, and seismic events (e.g., earthquake) are recognized as the most significant threats to the safety of bridges. In traditional risk assessment methods for structures susceptible to damage due to floods and other natural hazards (e.g., corrosion and seismic events), future hazard predictions are conducted using historic return periods and climate records. However, recent increase in flood intensity in central-southern states indicate that future hazard occurrence rate may not necessarily follow past trends. Accordingly, current design, assessment, and management methodologies should adapt to these changes in order to ensure the satisfactory performance of bridges under the combined or cumulative action of hazards. This project addresses this need by presenting a framework for risk quantification and optimum management of bridges susceptible to damage due to floods, flood induced scour, and other gradual deterioration mechanism (e.g., corrosion and fatigue). Downscaled climate data, adopted from the global climate models, are employed to predict future flood hazard at a given location. Probabilistic simulation is used to quantify the time-dependent failure probability, which subsequently helps quantify the long-term sustainability through the systematic integration of economic, social, and environmental metrics associated with bridge failures.

Hydraulic-related hazards (e.g., flood and scour), aggressive environmental conditions, and seismic events (e.g., earthquake) are recognized as the most significant threats to the safety of bridges. In traditional risk assessment methods for structures susceptible to damage due to floods and other natural hazards (e.g., corrosion and seismic events), future hazard predictions are conducted using historic return periods and climate records. However, recent increase in flood intensity in central-southern states indicate that future hazard occurrence rate may not necessarily follow past trends. Accordingly, current design, assessment, and management methodologies should adapt to these changes in order to ensure the satisfactory performance of bridges under the combined or cumulative action of hazards. This project addresses this need by presenting a framework for risk quantification and optimum management of bridges susceptible to damage due to floods, flood induced scour, and other gradual deterioration mechanism (e.g., corrosion and fatigue). Downscaled climate data, adopted from the global climate models, are employed to predict future flood hazard at a given location. Probabilistic simulation is used to quantify the time-dependent failure probability, which subsequently helps quantify the long-term sustainability through the systematic integration of economic, social, and environmental metrics associated with bridge failures. These profiles can be next used to obtain optimum interventions required to extend the service life while maintaining the structural performance above prescribed thresholds.\""],"descriptionType":["Abstract"]},{"description":["Tran-SET Project No. 17STOKS01"],"descriptionType":["Other"]}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":["https://zenodo.org/record/2230567"],"contentUrl":{},"metadataVersion":[2],"schemaVersion":{},"source":["mds"],"isActive":[true],"state":["findable"],"reason":{},"viewCount":[0],"downloadCount":[0],"referenceCount":[0],"citationCount":[0],"partCount":[0],"partOfCount":[1],"versionCount":[1],"versionOfCount":[0],"created":["2018-12-12T21:17:15Z"],"registered":["2018-12-12T21:17:16Z"],"published":{},"updated":["2020-07-15T21:23:20Z"]},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":["cern.zenodo"],"type":["clients"]}}}},{"id":["10.5063/aa/obfs2.389.1"],"type":["dois"],"attributes":{"doi":["10.5063/aa/obfs2.389.1"],"identifiers":[{"identifier":["https://doi.org/10.5063/aa/obfs2.389.1"],"identifierType":["DOI"]}],"creators":[{"name":["Smith, Bruce"],"nameType":["Personal"],"givenName":["Bruce"],"familyName":["Smith"],"affiliation":[{"name":["Oklahoma State University"]}],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["(OK) Univ Of Oklahoma Biological Station"],"affiliation":[],"nameIdentifiers":[]},{"name":["Organization Of Biological Field Stations"],"affiliation":[],"nameIdentifiers":[]}],"titles":[{"lang":["en"],"title":["Teaching Collection UOBS - Herbarium"]}],"publisher":["KNB Data Repository"],"container":{},"publicationYear":[2003],"subjects":[{"lang":["en"],"subject":["herbarium collections"]},{"lang":["en"],"subject":["plants"]},{"lang":["en"],"subject":["specimens"]},{"lang":["en"],"subject":["Oklahoma"]},{"lang":["en"],"subject":["Texas"]},{"lang":["en"],"subject":["Arkansas"]}],"contributors":[],"dates":[{"date":["2003"],"dateType":["Issued"]}],"language":["en"],"types":{"ris":["DATA"],"bibtex":["misc"],"citeproc":["dataset"],"schemaOrg":["Dataset"],"resourceTypeGeneral":["Dataset"]},"relatedIdentifiers":[],"relatedItems":[],"sizes":[],"formats":[["text/xml"]],"version":{},"rightsList":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":["en"],"description":["Specimens were collected and prepared by students and faculty at the University of Oklahoma Biological Station.
